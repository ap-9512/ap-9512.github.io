<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>My Review: </strong>This book, will show you Ramayan with a complete new and <em>interesting </em>picture. You will understand that there are many broken links in colloquial Ramayan. I didn't feel boring at all. You will understand that, evil existed even in those times. I'm eager to read the next book in the sequel. If you are dedicated, the book should only take around 2 days to read.</p>
<h2>My notes:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success dropcap">Lord Brahma, the Creator, one of the greatest scientists ever. He was credited with many inventions upon which the Vedic way of life had been built. His disciples lived by the code he’d established: relentless pursuit of knowledge and selfless service to society. They had, over the years, evolved into the tribe of Brahma, or Brahmins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement gives idea about the birth of Brahmin Caste. It should be noted that there is nothing special about initial Brahmins. It seems like they have come together because of their interest in knowledge. <em>It is not at all by their birth.</em></p>

<p class="msg msg--success">Periodically, when a way of life became inefficient, corrupt or fanatical, a new leader emerged, who guided his people to an improved social order. <em>Vishnu was an ancient title accorded to the greatest of leaders, idolised as the Propagators of Good.

<p>So <em>Ekam or One God</em> sends a person on this planet who brings radical changes to corrupted lifestyles of people.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So check for the meaning of your name. May be god has created you for that purpose.😄 Atleast act according your name. For example, my name meaning is: The one who doesn't return without a victory. So I should follow the quotation: "Be like a postage stamp, stick to one thing until you get there." Isn't it?</p>
<hr>

<p class="msg msg--success">In keeping with tradition, the princes had been accorded gurukul names: Ram was called Sudas, Bharat became Vasu, Lakshman was Paurav, and Shatrughan, Nalatardak.</p>

<p class="msg msg--success">‘Not revealing the truth is lying, isn’t it, Guruji?’ ‘No, it isn’t. Sometimes, truth causes pain and suffering. At such times, silence is preferred. In fact, there may be times when a white lie, or even an outright lie, could actually lead to a good outcome. Lying may save someone’s life. Lying may bring one into a position of authority, which in turn may result in an opportunity to do good. Would you still advocate not lying? It may well be said that a true leader loves his people more than he loves his own soul. There would be no doubt in the mind of such a leader. He would lie for the good of his people.’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Wisdom lies in moderation, in balance. If you lie to save an innocent person from some bandits, is that wrong?</em></span></p>
<p class="msg msg--success">Your habit of speaking the truth is good. But what is your reason for it? Is it because you believe it’s the lawful thing to do? Or, is it because this incident has made you fear lying?’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the conversation between Ram and his Guru about truth. Enlightening isn't it?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Nobody in Ayodhya gives two hoots about the law, Dada! We are a civilization in an advanced state of decay. We’re the most hypocritical people on earth. We criticize corruption in others, but are blind to our own dishonesty. We hate others who do wrong and commit crimes, blithely ignoring our own misdeeds, big and small. We vehemently blame Raavan for all our ills, refusing to acknowledge that we created the mess we find ourselves in.’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘This attitude is basic human nature. We’d rather look outward and blame others for the ills that befall us than point the finger at ourselves. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. We need a king who can create systems with which one can harness even selfish human nature for the betterment of society.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the battle of Karchappa, the kingdom of Ayodhya becomes very weak financially. This is mainly because of Raavan's aggressive trade policies causing losses among people. Everybody blames Raavan for his trade policies, forgetting that Ayodhya lost a war because of hasty decisions. This victory of Raavan has made him unquestionable.</p>
<p>So the discussion above is <strong>"We blame someone else for our mistakes and misfortunes."</strong></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>There’s a thin line that separates courage from stupidity.</em></span>’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘And that line is only visible in retrospect, my friend. If I’m successful, people will call me brave. If I fail, I will be called foolish. Let me do what I think is right. I’ll leave the verdict to the future.’</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success"> you compromise the prospects of the strong, and lean too much towards the interests of the weak, then your society itself goes into decline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is the biggest problem with communist ideology.</p>
<p>You should leave the strong in their own way until they don't interfere with your efforts to uplift the weak.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘A real leader doesn’t choose to lead only the deserving.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">He will, instead, inspire his people into becoming the best that they are capable of.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">A real leader will not defend a monster, but convert that demon into a God; tap into the God that dwells within even him.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">He takes upon himself the burden of dharma sankat, but he ensures that his people become better human beings.’<br><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ram says the above after his victory with Raavan at Mithila. He knows that if Asurastra is used then he will be banished for 14 years. But to save people, he should use Asurastra. So he takes the burden of living a hermit life for the sake of people.</p>
<p>So a real leader will do <em><strong>Selfless</strong></em> service for his people. He takes upon as much fault on himself to make their lives better.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">Sometimes wrath is required to deliver justice. But the strange thing about anger is that it is like fire; the more you feed it, the more it grows. It takes a lot of wisdom to know when to let anger go.<br><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <em>the problem with using violent methods for solution</em>. it is like a fire, you will need more of it, even after your main purpose is completed. </p>
<p>This is also highlighted by <em>Tales of Man Singh - Kenneth Anderson.</em> He says that Man Singh has started to save weaker sections from stronger section. But as he used violent methods, he keeps on killing many many people. At the end he is classified as murderer but the society doesn't change at large. There are many reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>May be people have thought that Man Singh was a rumor.</li>
<li>A covert gang cannot create its own law for a vast country like India.</li>
<li>Stronger sections always find a loop hole in everything. I think Man Singh was trying to destroy the effect leaving the cause on its own.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">Interestingly, Lord Yama was revered as both the God of Death as well as the God of Dharma. The ancients believed that dharma and death were interlinked.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">In a sense, a tally sheet was drawn at the end of one’s mortal life; if there was an imbalance, the soul would have to return to physical form in another mortal body; if the accounts were in balance and karma was in alignment with dharma, then the soul would attain ultimate salvation: release from the cycle of rebirth, and reunification with the universal soul, the Parmatma, the Ekam, the Brahman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the concept is death is simply a kind of financial year where you publish your accounts. If the market is happy your share value increases, otherwise you might even see the demise.</p>
<p>So, I think ancient people's thinking of Lord Yama as Lord for Dharma was also right. Because as soon as he takes the life, he will also make a judgement on where to send the soul to: Heaven? Hell? or club it with Parmatma?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">You are law-abiding people; you follow the masculine way. But your laws are not working anymore. They haven’t been for centuries, because the world has changed. That is what karma is trying to teach you, again and again. If karma is giving you a negative signal repeatedly, then it is not testing you, it is trying to teach you. You need to tap into the disciple in you and find a new Shukracharya. You need a new masculine way. You need new laws.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conversation happens between Lord Ram and Asuras. The key takeaway here is:</p>
<p>If you are not able to achieve success, then it is only a fault in yourself. Take note of it, change your ways, try another way. Hit the target. Here Shukracharya is Guru for Asuras, but in reality we should be our own Shukracharya, find new self-discipline and work with new ways to catch our result.</p>
<p>Simply giving up in the middle of the process, or trying with the same approach which has failed will not work. Instead you should learn from past mistakes and make amendments to your constitution.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘And if the Ekam is beyond all this [materialistic world], how can He pick a side?’ asked Ram.<br>‘If <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>He is beyond form</em></span> then how can He have a preference for any one form? He can, therefore, never belong to any one specific group. He belongs to all, and at the same time, to none. And this is not just applicable to human beings but to every created entity in the universe: animals, plants, water, earth, energy, stars, space, everything. Regardless of what they do or think or believe, all created entities belong to, and are drawn from, the Ekam.’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘This fundamental misunderstanding between our world of forms, and the Ekam’s formless world, makes them believe in the lie that my God is the true God and your God is a false God. Just like a wise human will have no preference for his kidneys over his liver, the One God will not pick one group over another. It’s stupid to even think otherwise.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows how ancient Indian's considered every life as precious and form of god. We should also understand that Hindus also believed that there is one god, who is governing this whole universe(similar to Christianity). </p>
<p>In fact, the concept of Ekam is beyond: even non-living things are also considered as some creation of god and so needs to be respected.<br>For example: Indian's have immense respect for rivers. They also offer prayers to rivers.</p>
<p>In essence treat every one and everything with respect. You are not beyond anything. Be humble. Remember? Humility was one of the virtues suggested by Benjamin Franklin to young people of the world.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Shukracharya was right in wanting to create a perfect masculine society. Such a society is efficient, just, and honorable. <br>The mistake he made was that he based it on faith. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><u>He should have built it purely on laws, keeping the spiritual separate from the material. When times change, as they inevitably do, one finds it impossible to give up on one’s faith; in fact, one clings to it with renewed vigor.</u></em> </span>Difficult times make men cling to their faith even more strongly. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But if you base a masculine way of life on laws, then, possibly, when needed, the laws can be changed. The masculine way of life should be built on laws, not faith.</span></em>’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should never mix religion with laws and society. Faith should be your own personal thing. Founding fathers of India knew this very well. So they never introduced any religious concept in our constitution. This probably is the reason why India has survived as a union till today. </p>
<p>If religious sermons are made into laws, then the biggest problem is that the society will not progress. Because religious laws were formed many many years ago based on the then society. Religion is not something where you can speak of amendments. So without amendments how can you progress? Even further this can create intolerance in people and can create chaos.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sukracharya's people were rigid in their belief of Ekam and so never tolerated people who believed other gods.</li>
<li>Many islamic countries are today facing these kind of problems.</li>
<li>Of late in India, mention of religion(s) in CAA, NRC has created chaos.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">In the middle ages of the Devas, the caste system, which was originally based on karma and not birth, became rigid, sectarian and politicized. This allowed the Asuras to easily defeat them. When the later Devas reformed and made the caste system flexible again, they regained their strength and defeated the Asuras.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think even today, the caste system should be completely abolished. The main reason is every person takes pride in his job. So he being a parent will only force his/her child to do that job even if his child has interests in some other field. For example, when I was young, my interests were to start an airline and build a vast business empire. Every time I confessed this to my father, he always discouraged me. He would only say, that we are not for business and our way of life was to learn and work under someone.(of course he has seen his brother fail with the concept of business) Again I was also fascinated about those giant Diesel locomotives. When I proposed I wanted to work with railways, my parents both discouraged me. They instead wanted me to work for Oil companies. This is one of the reason for why I hated those Oil companies.</p>
<p>Anyways, the concept is observe and encourage your child in the direction s/he can make an impact. It doesn't matter if it is a field that doesn't pay well or is not respected. Every field has a legend, and your child can be next legend. Also, be happy if your child chooses a very rare field. There is very less competition😉.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">Life is complicated, and a balanced person can see both sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Sometimes, to create a perfect world, a leader has to do what is necessary at the time; even if it may not appear to be the “right” thing to do in the short term. In the long run, a leader who has the capacity to uplift the masses must not deny himself that opportunity. He has a duty to not make himself unavailable. A true leader will even take a sin upon his soul for the good of his people.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember an anecdote: PV Narsimha Rao, former prime minister of India while introducing reforms was said to have encouraged Manmohan Singh, then finance minister as follows:</p>
<p>If anything goes wrong, then it will be my fault as a leader. If everything goes as per plan and society benefits, then the credit is yours.</p>
<p>Exceptional leader, isn't he?</p>
<p>And today, India is an assertive power in international affairs, partly because of his liberalization.</p>
<p>Another example is Jawaharlal Nehru who took the burden of leading a new India. Some of his reforms/decisions have gone wrong. He courageously took all the critics, but till end he thrived to uplift every poor Indian. </p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">A leader is not just one who leads. He must also be a role model. He must practise what he preaches......</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obvious, because if he doesn't practice what he preaches who will listen to him? For example if a person(a very good leader) who is a hard core non-vegetarian(eats what ever animal he finds) talks about animal rights, will you listen?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Well, Lord Rudra had said: “A leader is not just one who gives his people what they want. He must also be the one who teaches his people to be better than they imagined themselves to be”.’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">In reply, Lady Mohini said that people have their limitations. A leader should not expect more from them than what they are capable of. If you stretch them beyond their capacity, they will break.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is always a maximum for everything!! But that should not stop a good leader from trying to achieve as much as s/he can for his people.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">Sita had thought long and hard about the meaning of equality. She felt that just promoting equality before the law would not solve society’s problems. She believed that true equality existed only at the level of the soul. But in this material world, everyone was, in fact, not equal. No two created entities were exactly the same. Among humans, some were better at knowledge, others at warfare, some at trading and others offered their manual skills and hard work. She believed that a society would be perfect only if people were free to do what they actually wanted to, based on their karma, rather than following the diktats of the caste they were born into.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think, this is the simple reason for how reservations in India have overcome legal hurdles. But still today India is an unequal society mainly because of caste feelings.</p>
<p>Most of the democracies somehow at the end will and should fall in line with this concept, atleast in the application law.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">We need to be harsh to destroy this birth-based caste system,’ said Sita. ‘It has weakened our dharma and our country. It must be destroyed for the good of India. If we don’t destroy the caste system as it exists today, we will open ourselves to attacks from foreigners. They will use our divisions to conquer us.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Sita's warnings were true. There were so many invasions which exploited caste based system prevalent in those times. Examples are Mughals, Britishers etc.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Lady Sita proposed that all the children of a kingdom must be compulsorily adopted by the state at the time of birth. The birth-parents would have to surrender their children to the kingdom. The kingdom would raise these children, educate and hone the natural skills that they were born with. At the age of fifteen, they would appear for an examination that would test them on their physical, psychological and mental skills. Based on the result, appropriate castes would be allocated to the children.<br><br></p>
<p>Subsequent training would further polish their natural talent, after which the children would be put up for adoption by citizens from the same caste as the ones assigned to the adolescents through the examination process. The children would never know their birth-parents, only their caste-parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course this is an impossible thing. But we should find some or the other way to abolish caste system. We should understand that the above system if modified can become possible. Don't ask me the modifications to be made, I don't know. My opinion is everybody's thought is of some value to make this country a great one. Instead of skirting the opinion we should try to make a note of it and move ahead. </p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘But polygamy is unfair only according to you[Lord Ram]; others may disagree. Remember, justice in terms of “right” or “wrong” is a man-made concept. It is entirely up to us to define justice in new terms of what is fair or unfair. It will be for the greater good.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this type of philosophy is called deist theory. Please correct me, if I'm wrong. I read about this type of philosophy in Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘You know, Guru Vashishtha had said to me, when I was a child, that compassion is sometimes an overrated virtue.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">He told me the story of the butterfly emerging from the hard pupa.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">It squeezes through this tiny opening and struggles to make its way out. This is a difficult, painful and prolonged process. Misguided compassion may make us want to enlarge the hole in the pupa, imagining that it would ease the butterfly’s task. But that struggle is necessary; as the butterfly squeezes its body out of the tiny hole, it secretes fluids within its swollen body. This fluid goes to its wings, strengthening them;</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">Without the struggle, its wings would never gain strength. It would never fly.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very simple example on why man shouldn't interfere with nature's processes. At the end he will only destroy himself. </p>
<p>In other words, if a person is struggling in his journey to become great then we should leave him for himself and should not interfere. </p>
<p>I think this is the main reason why great people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Jack Ma... who talk about helping people don't simply give money to everyone. I don't know if I'm making sense to you, but I'm making sense to myself. As they have climbed that ladder they knew that with hard work, patience, perseverance, every person will make it there without great people's help.</p>
<p>So it is better to leave that person to create his own journey which can make him more happy than the person who receives someone's gratitude. It is the law of nature isn't it?</p>
<p>But you should help a person who is in need.  For example, help a hungry person, help a sick person, vaccinate a child etc... mainly so that they can live and make <em>themselves</em> happy.</p>

<p>You should leave the strong in their own way until they don't interfere with your efforts to uplift the weak.</p>

<p>Ram says the above after his victory with Raavan at Mithila. He knows that if Asurastra is used then he will be banished for 14 years. But to save people, he should use Asurastra. So he takes the burden of living a hermit life for the sake of people.</p>
<p>So a real leader will do <em><strong>Selfless</strong></em> service for his people. He takes upon as much fault on himself to make their lives better.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is <em>the problem with using violent methods for solution</em>. it is like a fire, you will need more of it, even after your main purpose is completed. </p>
<p>This is also highlighted by <em>Tales of Man Singh - Kenneth Anderson.</em> He says that Man Singh has started to save weaker sections from stronger section. But as he used violent methods, he keeps on killing many many people. At the end he is classified as murderer but the society doesn't change at large. There are many reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>May be people have thought that Man Singh was a rumor.</li>
<li>A covert gang cannot create its own law for a vast country like India.</li>
<li>Stronger sections always find a loop hole in everything. I think Man Singh was trying to destroy the effect leaving the cause on its own.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">Interestingly, Lord Yama was revered as both the God of Death as well as the God of Dharma. The ancients believed that dharma and death were interlinked.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">In a sense, a tally sheet was drawn at the end of one’s mortal life; if there was an imbalance, the soul would have to return to physical form in another mortal body; if the accounts were in balance and karma was in alignment with dharma, then the soul would attain ultimate salvation: release from the cycle of rebirth, and reunification with the universal soul, the Parmatma, the Ekam, the Brahman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the concept is death is simply a kind of financial year where you publish your accounts. If the market is happy your share value increases, otherwise you might even see the demise.</p>
<p>So, I think ancient people's thinking of Lord Yama as Lord for Dharma was also right. Because as soon as he takes the life, he will also make a judgement on where to send the soul to: Heaven? Hell? or club it with Parmatma?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">You are law-abiding people; you follow the masculine way. But your laws are not working anymore. They haven’t been for centuries, because the world has changed. That is what karma is trying to teach you, again and again. If karma is giving you a negative signal repeatedly, then it is not testing you, it is trying to teach you. You need to tap into the disciple in you and find a new Shukracharya. You need a new masculine way. You need new laws.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conversation happens between Lord Ram and Asuras. The key takeaway here is:</p>
<p>If you are not able to achieve success, then it is only a fault in yourself. Take note of it, change your ways, try another way. Hit the target. Here Shukracharya is Guru for Asuras, but in reality we should be our own Shukracharya, find new self-discipline and work with new ways to catch our result.</p>
<p>Simply giving up in the middle of the process, or trying with the same approach which has failed will not work. Instead you should learn from past mistakes and make amendments to your constitution.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘And if the Ekam is beyond all this [materialistic world], how can He pick a side?’ asked Ram.<br>‘If <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>He is beyond form</em></span> then how can He have a preference for any one form? He can, therefore, never belong to any one specific group. He belongs to all, and at the same time, to none. And this is not just applicable to human beings but to every created entity in the universe: animals, plants, water, earth, energy, stars, space, everything. Regardless of what they do or think or believe, all created entities belong to, and are drawn from, the Ekam.’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘This fundamental misunderstanding between our world of forms, and the Ekam’s formless world, makes them believe in the lie that my God is the true God and your God is a false God. Just like a wise human will have no preference for his kidneys over his liver, the One God will not pick one group over another. It’s stupid to even think otherwise.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows how ancient Indian's considered every life as precious and form of god. We should also understand that Hindus also believed that there is one god, who is governing this whole universe(similar to Christianity). </p>
<p>In fact, the concept of Ekam is beyond: even non-living things are also considered as some creation of god and so needs to be respected.<br>For example: Indian's have immense respect for rivers. They also offer prayers to rivers.</p>
<p>In essence treat every one and everything with respect. You are not beyond anything. Be humble. Remember? Humility was one of the virtues suggested by Benjamin Franklin to young people of the world.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Shukracharya was right in wanting to create a perfect masculine society. Such a society is efficient, just, and honorable. <br>The mistake he made was that he based it on faith. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><u>He should have built it purely on laws, keeping the spiritual separate from the material. When times change, as they inevitably do, one finds it impossible to give up on one’s faith; in fact, one clings to it with renewed vigor.</u></em> </span>Difficult times make men cling to their faith even more strongly. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But if you base a masculine way of life on laws, then, possibly, when needed, the laws can be changed. The masculine way of life should be built on laws, not faith.</span></em>’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should never mix religion with laws and society. Faith should be your own personal thing. Founding fathers of India knew this very well. So they never introduced any religious concept in our constitution. This probably is the reason why India has survived as a union till today. </p>
<p>If religious sermons are made into laws, then the biggest problem is that the society will not progress. Because religious laws were formed many many years ago based on the then society. Religion is not something where you can speak of amendments. So without amendments how can you progress? Even further this can create intolerance in people and can create chaos.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sukracharya's people were rigid in their belief of Ekam and so never tolerated people who believed other gods.</li>
<li>Many islamic countries are today facing these kind of problems.</li>
<li>Of late in India, mention of religion(s) in CAA, NRC has created chaos.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">In the middle ages of the Devas, the caste system, which was originally based on karma and not birth, became rigid, sectarian and politicized. This allowed the Asuras to easily defeat them. When the later Devas reformed and made the caste system flexible again, they regained their strength and defeated the Asuras.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think even today, the caste system should be completely abolished. The main reason is every person takes pride in his job. So he being a parent will only force his/her child to do that job even if his child has interests in some other field. For example, when I was young, my interests were to start an airline and build a vast business empire. Every time I confessed this to my father, he always discouraged me. He would only say, that we are not for business and our way of life was to learn and work under someone.(of course he has seen his brother fail with the concept of business) Again I was also fascinated about those giant Diesel locomotives. When I proposed I wanted to work with railways, my parents both discouraged me. They instead wanted me to work for Oil companies. This is one of the reason for why I hated those Oil companies.</p>
<p>Anyways, the concept is observe and encourage your child in the direction s/he can make an impact. It doesn't matter if it is a field that doesn't pay well or is not respected. Every field has a legend, and your child can be next legend. Also, be happy if your child chooses a very rare field. There is very less competition😉.</p>

<p class="msg msg--success">Life is complicated, and a balanced person can see both sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Sometimes, to create a perfect world, a leader has to do what is necessary at the time; even if it may not appear to be the “right” thing to do in the short term. In the long run, a leader who has the capacity to uplift the masses must not deny himself that opportunity. He has a duty to not make himself unavailable. A true leader will even take a sin upon his soul for the good of his people.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember an anecdote: PV Narsimha Rao, former prime minister of India while introducing reforms was said to have encouraged Manmohan Singh, then finance minister as follows:</p>
<p>If anything goes wrong, then it will be my fault as a leader. If everything goes as per plan and society benefits, then the credit is yours.</p>
<p>Exceptional leader, isn't he?</p>
<p>And today, India is an assertive power in international affairs, partly because of his liberalization.</p>
<p>Another example is Jawaharlal Nehru who took the burden of leading a new India. Some of his reforms/decisions have gone wrong. He courageously took all the critics, but till end he thrived to uplift every poor Indian. </p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">A leader is not just one who leads. He must also be a role model. He must practise what he preaches......</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obvious, because if he doesn't practice what he preaches who will listen to him? For example if a person(a very good leader) who is a hard core non-vegetarian(eats what ever animal he finds) talks about animal rights, will you listen?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Well, Lord Rudra had said: “A leader is not just one who gives his people what they want. He must also be the one who teaches his people to be better than they imagined themselves to be”.’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">In reply, Lady Mohini said that people have their limitations. A leader should not expect more from them than what they are capable of. If you stretch them beyond their capacity, they will break.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is always a maximum for everything!! But that should not stop a good leader from trying to achieve as much as s/he can for his people.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">Sita had thought long and hard about the meaning of equality. She felt that just promoting equality before the law would not solve society’s problems. She believed that true equality existed only at the level of the soul. But in this material world, everyone was, in fact, not equal. No two created entities were exactly the same. Among humans, some were better at knowledge, others at warfare, some at trading and others offered their manual skills and hard work. She believed that a society would be perfect only if people were free to do what they actually wanted to, based on their karma, rather than following the diktats of the caste they were born into.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think, this is the simple reason for how reservations in India have overcome legal hurdles. But still today India is an unequal society mainly because of caste feelings.</p>
<p>Most of the democracies somehow at the end will and should fall in line with this concept, atleast in the application law.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">We need to be harsh to destroy this birth-based caste system,’ said Sita. ‘It has weakened our dharma and our country. It must be destroyed for the good of India. If we don’t destroy the caste system as it exists today, we will open ourselves to attacks from foreigners. They will use our divisions to conquer us.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Sita's warnings were true. There were so many invasions which exploited caste based system prevalent in those times. Examples are Mughals, Britishers etc.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Lady Sita proposed that all the children of a kingdom must be compulsorily adopted by the state at the time of birth. The birth-parents would have to surrender their children to the kingdom. The kingdom would raise these children, educate and hone the natural skills that they were born with. At the age of fifteen, they would appear for an examination that would test them on their physical, psychological and mental skills. Based on the result, appropriate castes would be allocated to the children.<br><br></p>
<p>Subsequent training would further polish their natural talent, after which the children would be put up for adoption by citizens from the same caste as the ones assigned to the adolescents through the examination process. The children would never know their birth-parents, only their caste-parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course this is an impossible thing. But we should find some or the other way to abolish caste system. We should understand that the above system if modified can become possible. Don't ask me the modifications to be made, I don't know. My opinion is everybody's thought is of some value to make this country a great one. Instead of skirting the opinion we should try to make a note of it and move ahead. </p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘But polygamy is unfair only according to you[Lord Ram]; others may disagree. Remember, justice in terms of “right” or “wrong” is a man-made concept. It is entirely up to us to define justice in new terms of what is fair or unfair. It will be for the greater good.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this type of philosophy is called deist theory. Please correct me, if I'm wrong. I read about this type of philosophy in Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘You know, Guru Vashishtha had said to me, when I was a child, that compassion is sometimes an overrated virtue.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">He told me the story of the butterfly emerging from the hard pupa.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">It squeezes through this tiny opening and struggles to make its way out. This is a difficult, painful and prolonged process. Misguided compassion may make us want to enlarge the hole in the pupa, imagining that it would ease the butterfly’s task. But that struggle is necessary; as the butterfly squeezes its body out of the tiny hole, it secretes fluids within its swollen body. This fluid goes to its wings, strengthening them;</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">Without the struggle, its wings would never gain strength. It would never fly.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very simple example on why man shouldn't interfere with nature's processes. At the end he will only destroy himself. </p>
<p>In other words, if a person is struggling in his journey to become great then we should leave him for himself and should not interfere. </p>
<p>I think this is the main reason why great people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Jack Ma... who talk about helping people don't simply give money to everyone. I don't know if I'm making sense to you, but I'm making sense to myself. As they have climbed that ladder they knew that with hard work, patience, perseverance, every person will make it there without great people's help.</p>
<p>So it is better to leave that person to create his own journey which can make him more happy than the person who receives someone's gratitude. It is the law of nature isn't it?</p>
<p>But you should help a person who is in need.  For example, help a hungry person, help a sick person, vaccinate a child etc... mainly so that they can live and make <em>themselves</em> happy.</p>

<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>My Review: </strong>A good motivating book. The book introduces the success formula using a story format. The main concept is only at the end. You will have to read the given chapter for 100 days without break and with full heart. I am still on third day and will write an update here, once I complete 100 days. It is expected that there will be a change in the behavior and your attitude.</p>

<p>The following are my notes/quotation which I really liked:</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">"The beginning of pride is in heaven. The continuance of pride is on earth. The end of pride is in hell."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definition of pride: <em>a feeling or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements, the achievements of those with whom one is closely associated, or from qualities or possessions that are widely admired.</em></p>
<p>Definition itself says everything. I don't have many words to add.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">Most humans, in varying degrees, are already dead. In one way or another they have lost their dreams, their ambitions, their desire for a better life. They have surrendered their fight for self-esteem and they have compromised their great potential. They have settled for a life of mediocrity, days of despair and nights of tears. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>They are no more than living deaths</em></span> confined to cemeteries of their choice. Yet they need not remain in that state. They can be resurrected from their sorry condition. They can each perform the greatest miracle in the world. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>They can each come back from the dead... and in those books are the simple secrets, techniques, and methods</em></span> which they can still apply to their own lives to become anything they wish to be and to attain all the true riches of life."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author emphasizes book reading as a habit to reach success. In some sense, he is talking about books like Elliot's five foot collection. He encourages us to read books that will make you think, inculcate values. But he also says that he has already read most of the great books and found that they all teach the same thing albeit in different ways. </p>
<p>He says that today people are forgetting their dreams ambitions etc. which have driven our life during our childhood. Instead we are living in a safe zone and have given up our ambitions. This is creating the whole problems. We are living like dead without any new hope etc.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>most of us build prisons for ourselves</em></span> and after we occupy them for a period of time <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>we become accustomed to their walls and accept the false premise that we are incarcerated for life</em></span>. As soon as that belief takes hold of us we abandon hope of ever doing more with our lives and of ever giving our dreams a chance to be fulfilled. We become puppets and begin to suffer living deaths. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>It may be praiseworthy and noble to sacrifice your life to a cause</em></span> or a business or the happiness of others, but if you are miserable and unfulfilled in that lifestyle, and know it, then to remain in it is a hypocrisy, a lie, and a rejection of the faith placed in you by your creator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He says, that we are blaming our situation/series of events/god for our bad luck. We donot understand that this was our fault. We forget that it was we whole have tried to create this wall in the name of future security. As time passes we get accustomed to the fate we have created and live like dead.</p>
<p>He says that instead of living a miserable life(even if you are financially successful), live a life which keeps us happy. We should live for a cause which will make our life a mark in history. Live for your ambition, childhood dream etc. We should start living for the purpose for which the creator has created us. Don't live in a lie, comparing your riches with a poor(may be he is more happy!), or comparing your literacy with an illiterate(may be he has more good moral values than yours.). It is better to live a life which will help uplift somebody's life for that can give you immense happiness which not even earning millions of dollars. Because we are humans and have evolved by living in a society. A smile in other person's face will make you more happy than million dollars in your bank account.</p>

<p class="msg msg--success">our mind is the greatest creation on earth and it can generate the most sublime happiness for its owner—or it can destroy him. Yet, although we have been given the secret of how to control it, for our happiness and benefit, we still function completely ignorant of its potential, like the most stupid of animals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way we perceive this world depends on how we see it. if you see yourself in a hell, then even heaven will look like hell😂. We should be open and broad minded. We should avoid prejudice on every topic. Stop complaining. </p>
<p>The best way to keep make yourself in heaven is to first de-clutter yourself. Do one thing at a time. This is my personal experience. For example, while reading a wikipedia article if I start opening all the hyperlinks, then at the end the overwhelming information makes me feel exhausted and at the end I will only have superficial knowledge about the main topic I wanted to read. Because our cognitive capacity is limited. Use it wisely.</p>
<p>Start to forgive<br>Start to believe god is with you<br>Start to beieve what ever is happening is for your good<br>Don't forget to take calculated risks......</p>
<p>Every person has his time. You should be patient. When time is ripe, when you are ready to serve your purpose, sometimes unknowingly you will be pushed by god to serve your purpose and make this world a beautiful place.</p>
<p>The way think, the way it will happen. So start being optimistic.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Everybody has a unique purpose in this world. But we don't believe in that. We can do what ever can be done by any person on this planet. We can do what Jeff Bezos can do, we can do what Bill Gates can do.... We don't believe it because we are anxious(because of negative thoughts, fear of any harm, safety offered by safe zone. In sum, we are first of all feared of any new thing happening in our life.), guilt(because we continue to live in our past. We are not able to forgive ourselves. Of course regretting the past is good. But we should understand that once we have learnt the lesson, we should be steadfast not to repeat it. Everybody in life makes a mistake. There is no need to continue to live in past just because you have done/experienced something wrong. First thing you have to understand is to forgive others, forgive yourself. For this start with an apology keeping aside your pride!), inferiority(because you have failed in the past doesn't mean you shouldn't try again. First check the cause for your failure. Mostly the failure is because you have not believed yourself "<em>completely</em>" that you can do the task. This led to you only applying partial of yourself. The other reason is surrounding yourself with foolish and pessimistic people who don't believe in you or your ideology. Don't worry start afresh, believing completely yourself, surrounding yourself with <em>"only few"</em> optimistic people who believe in you and your ideology, have patience, perseverance. Dedicate yourself completely.)</p>
<p><strong>And don't copy or imitate anyone. Do it your own way. If you solve your problem with some other's strategy it will not work and you will fail. You will be writing a different(difficult) answer for a easy question.</strong></p>

<p>This quote applies to a person who has committed himself/herself to a work s/he dislikes.  If you are not happy with your work, just leave it. Do something that you like.

</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, the above quote says: experience is something which we can gain in many ways. There is no need to do a job just because you will gain experience. Instead strive for wisdom. If you want to gain experience(in the job that you love to do) for example on how to serve people, you can do it in many ways: start an NGO, become IAS, become Chief Minister, become Prime Minister.... Every path is different but you will learn a lot. Choose the path that you are comfortable with. And remember all the paths converge at the end depending upon your effort.</p>

<p>Work with passion. Give your 100%. There is nothing in this world that you cannot achieve(at least you can achieve everthing which someone has already achieved). For example: Benjamin Franklin in his autobiography says that he used to open his printing press early even before most people in the city woke up, and closed after many were asleep. <strong>This is called as dedication</strong>. Work hard and dedicate yourself. You will get everything in your life. Just time matters.</p>

<p class="msg msg--success">Norman Vincent Peale once said that the only time he found people with no problems was when he walked through a cemetery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understand that you are not the only person with problems. Everybody has his/her own set of problems. Only a person who fails complain about their problems. A successful person never even thinks about his problem as a problem itself. S/he sees it as an opportunity. For example, if you are building house and some one who is jealous of you tries to vandalize your house by hurling stones. A successful person takes those stones and uses it in construction. The person who is throwing the stone at the end should have financed the construction of your house.</p>

We may all be puppets on a string but we must learn what controls that string, out there, and then cut it, otherwise we will never reach our full potential nor will we ever regain our self-esteem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In essence, don't believe in astrology or other devil stuff. Because it is a double edged sword. Instead believe in yourself. <strong>Find the cause for your failure, not a scrape goat for your failure. </strong>There is something that is stopping you from success: <strong>Guilt? Inferiority? Anxiety?....</strong> Just find out, stop it from influencing you. Success will be yours.</p>
<p>Just believe: <em><strong>"god is with you."</strong></em></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">"Nothing is more disgraceful than that an old man should have nothing to show to prove that he has lived long, except his years."<br><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Live your life such that people are ready to write books about you, make movies about you, follow you.... Make history. Live like you have lived your life not your days.</p>
<p>"While you die, you should feel satisfied that you have given 100% of what you are capable of. Leave rest to history, it will record your name"</p>

<p class="msg msg--success">'The God Memorandum' is only your ticket to a new life. It will do nothing for you unless you open your mind and your heart to receive it. By itself it will move you not one inch in any direction. The means of transportation, and the power to break your inertia, must be generated by forces long dormant but still alive within you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now at the end, author gives tells us the synopsis of most of the great books. He presents it in the form of God's memorandum. He tells us:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, mark this day upon your calendar. Then, count forward one hundred days and mark that day.<br>
<ul>
<li>My 100<sup>th</sup> day falls on October 25 2020.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create some amulet and wear it such that it is visible. It should continuously remind you about the God's memorandum and its values for next 100 days. it should remind you that you are progressing in your life. You are going to become a different and great person by the end of 100 days.
<ul>
<li>As of writing I haven't created anything of that sorts. May be I should think of something of that sorts. I will update as soon as I do so.</li>
<li>Suggestion of author is to use a paper pin and a waste cloth(possessions of a rag picker) as your amulet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not, under any conditions, divulge the meaning of your amulet to those who may inquire during your hundred-day mission.<br>
<ul>
<li>I think this will help you not get discouraged by fools and their propaganda. </li>
<li>It can also be like: some curious people will ask about this everyday until they get the answer. May be this kind of questioning will be a constant reminder for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read 'The God Memorandum' before you retire, each night, for one hundred nights... and then sleep in peace, Let no reason or excuse force you to forego the reading for even one night. </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">By the hundredth day... you will be a living miracle... a new person...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After you experience change in you, only after[100 days] you experience change you can become another rag picker(A person who finds scrap, here scrap refers to people who are living dead) and share this philosophy. But be careful to share this philosophy to only a person who will for sure listen to you. Otherwise they might simply make fun of you and discourage you.</p>
<p>And do it only with love and compassion.</p>

<p>Author: Lynn Austin</p>
<p>Reading Time: Around 2.5 days</p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">First: My thoughts:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Women:</span>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A person who prays to real god will respect women. </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He will treat all the women in life with dignity. </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He will respect their thoughts, opinions etc.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Every life is important.</span></li>
<li>Believe in one god, don't simply pray to all the god you will encounter because every religion preaches same thing. But in different ways. If you keep on switching the religions(or all more gods to your religion), then you might interpret the preaching in wrong way(because each religion has its own custom) and do wrong to this world.</li>
<li>Stay away from all the new Babas flooding the market. They are all pagans.
<ul>
<li>In my opinion(Only my opinion and you may disagree. I will respect your opinion also) Sai Baba is very new. So my belief of not praying to him is also okay!🤔</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> God will answer your questions but not in a way you see in movies. Just keep complete faith in him. But at some point based on your faith, you will certainly <em>feel</em> his presence.</li>
<li>Every person has a purpose to do in his life(Zechariah's purpose in life was to build the holy temple). You should take that one step in your life to fulfill that purpose. Otherwise somebody else born with the same purpose will do it. Ex: Berekiah and his brother were reluctant to take the chance, they couldn't make it into history.</li>
<li>Forgive people because they are doing things because of ignorance. They will regret doing such things later in their life.
<ul>
<li>Ex: Yael wanted to elope with Rafi. If she had did that even after warning from elders(of course if Rafi would have accepted that proposal), then she would have regretted taking that decision. As god was very kind, he:
<ul>
<li>Didn't allow Rafi to accept the proposal for being eloping.</li>
<li>Sent Zachariah to save her.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another example is Iddo saw her wife Dinah committing adultery. He forgave her. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can only win people's heart by love and not by forcing them. Of course god will create an opportunity to express your love. Wait Patiently. </li>
<li>Patience is always needed. Because you will see so many hurdles in your life before you accomplish your task. Even if you doing something related to god. He will test your patience.</li>
<li>Never pray to god because you fear him, pray to with love. 
<ul>
<li>Example: I'm preparing for IAS exam. I can crack the exam and become IAS officer without praying to god also. There are two problems: First, it will take long time. Second, I will achieve success in wrong way because without god's help I will(may) not be able to get rid of masturbation. </li>
<li>But with god's help I will be able to delegate the task of getting rid of my bad habits(Masturbation + Excess sleep). With this I only have to concentrate on my studies. So I will do it the right way + withing short span of time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are confused, or for that matter if you want to start anything pray god for his guidance.</li>
<li>God might have created stars to foresee, but it is very difficult to predict something just by astrology. You need expertise to predict completely. In my opinion having seen my mother(she is still a beginner) &amp; her gurus, you will always miss a star/something and will get a wrong answer. Also I think, if a person has gained so much expertise to foresee 100% accurately, s/he should also have seen god.
<ul>
<li>Example: Recently, these seers were not able to predict the upcoming danger - Corona. They failed completely. They extended the last date for Corona virus as many times as Modi government extended lockdown!!😕</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be brave if you are doing right thing even if it hard and has some dilemmas.
<ul>
<li>Example: King Zerubbabel, took a brave decision not to halt the construction of the temple for good of the society even he was asked to stop it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some lines which I felt interesting from the book:</p>
<p>This is about astrology, idolatry etc.....</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--warning">“This is how idolatry begins,” Iddo said. “With simple curiosity. Before long, we grow accustomed to seeking signs and omens, and they no longer seem like abominations. The idols seem worthy of our worship. The pagans believe they can manipulate their false gods and bribe them to do their bidding. But the Holy One cannot be bribed. Instead we bend our wills to match His. The Torah instructs us to remain separate, to be holy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is about the need for law, restriction on us in the form of religious texts, constitution etc.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--warning">Because we’re not free when there are no boundaries—we’re in great danger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is about disability in every person(Conversation between Yael and Hodaya(who is differently abled)):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--warning">Every one of us has things about us that aren’t perfect—it’s just that yours is a little more noticeable than ours.<br><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally this is about how problem givers behave:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--warning">As the proverb says of evildoers, ‘their feet rush into sin.’</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Review:</h2>
<p>Babylonian king sees a hand in air(only hand without any person) writing something on a wall when they are partying. Now king gets worried and calls Rebbe Daniel to read the script for king. Daniel reads the script and tells that it is a warning from god for all the mistakes they have committed by taking Jews into captivity and making them slaves. He says that Babylonian king will be killed and conquered by Persians.</p>
<p>As written by the hand, Persians will conquer the land and kill Babylonian king. Now the talk of whether Jews will be freed from captivity or not starts. But for few months the routine in the kingdoms continues as usual.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zachariah(grandson of Iddo) continues his studies with Torah. Iddo and his family continue their worship etc. as usual. Yael is Zachariah's neighbor and also his friend. Her mother is ill, and Yael's family consult astrologers, pagan gods etc. for her cure. At last her mother dies. But, Yael is lured by a sorceress about the astrology(which according to Jewish tradition is wrong).</p>
<p>After few months the new king Cyrus accepts that the Jewish people should be left free and should also be allowed to build their temple. Iddo decides to leave but his sons and daughters are not ready to leave because they are satisfied with Babylonian life. Mattaniah(Yael's father) also decides to leave. Zachariah who is close to his grandfather falls in dilemma whether to leave with his grandfather or stay with his parents. At last Zachariah feels the presence of god's message: that he should go to Jerusalem leaving his parents behind.</p>
<p>Yael dosn't want to leave Babylon because here mother's mortal remains are there and also she likes to learn more about sorcery. So she runs away on the day of journey. But Mattaniah finally finds her and brings her back. They start their journey and reach Jerusalem.</p>
<p>After their arrival, they are asked to leave by the local people. But Jews continue to stay in Jerusalem. They start building their temple, but will have to face so many hurdles. </p>
<ul>
<li>First hurdle comes from local people who like to participate in construction of the temple. But Jews don't like that offer because, if local Samaritans are allowed to participate they will have as much right to offer prayer to god in sanctum, which their god forbids. So they bring political pressure and make sure that the construction activity stops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Locals also start terrorist attacks on Jews. In the process Iddo's wife Dinah losses her cousin and best friend ~Soshanna.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Iddo's decision to convince elders in the Jewish community leads to attack on Soshanna and Dinah. In the process Dinah looses Soshanna. Now Dinah starts blaming Iddo for his decision to both leave her family(sons and daughters) at Babylon and also the decision to convince elders to turn down the offer from locals for building the temple.</p>
<p>Dinah sees that Joel(Soshanna's husband) feel desolate and tries to comfort him. She suddenly feels happy with Joel. One day when both of them are hugging each other Iddo arrives and feels the agony. At last he forgives her and this causes her so much guilt. Also she tells the truth that Dinah has not committed any physical adultery and only mentally. Of Joel only lures Dinah because he wants to take revenge on Iddo's convincing. Joel's feeling is: "Iddo and other priests who supported the idea of turning down the offer should have lost their wives."</p>
<p>Matannaiah after reaching Jerusalem itself buys a patch of land from local people and starts farming. In the process Yael makes friend of Land lord and local village leader Zabad's(He is also a Jew) daughter Leyla. Leyla is a weak person and Yael uses her astrology to predict her future and also cheers her up so that usually Leyla's illness reduces. Because of Sorcery she makes new friends(Leyla's grandmother who also has some knowledge and believes sorcery) and also gains so much reputation among locals. </p>
<p>Now one day Zabad's wife gives birth to a baby with the help of midwife Dinah. But that baby is discarded because of her Disability. Dinah hates that idea and brings that baby to home. She names her Hodaya and is adopted by Iddo and Hodaya. </p>
<p>Yael's friend Leyla is married to a business person. After few days she dies while giving birth to a baby. Yael along with Leyla's brother Rafi mourn the loss and in the process fall in love with each other. Mattaniah hates that love(Because of their customs and ill respect towards women) and gets Yael married to Zachariah(who from childhood loved her and tried many times to keep her away from Leyla and Sorcery).</p>
<p>Meanwhile many of Yael's predictions go wrong(even her prediction of getting married with Rafi). After Yael's marriage with Zachariah, Rafi shows his true colour by trying to kill both Yael and Zachariah. Rafi didn't want something which he could get. While Rafi tries to kill both of them, Iddo gets and bad dream and wakes up to see that their grandchildren are under threat and saves them. In the process, Iddo takes a stab in his stomach from Rafi. Rafi is killed in the process. Iddo lives on surviving the attack.</p>
<p>After few years, drought creates shortage of food and water in Jerusalem. Now they realize that the wrath of god has created this and at the end they start building the temple again.</p>
<p>This time they are again stopped by local government but they continue the work in spite of threats because of their belief of god. At the end the kingdom archives are searched and they find that the perished king Cyrus's(persian king who conquered the Babylon) proclamation for letting Jews go home and build their temple. New king orders the local government not to cause any trouble for Jews. </p>
<p>Meanwhile Zachariah feels gods' presence again. </p>
<p>At the end temple is finished and god starts his journey to stay with the people of Jerusalem. </p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Review: </strong>A good book, which is not at all boring except for a very few places. If you are not a christian or jew then reading this book will improve your knowledge about their religion. The book also encourages many ethical values that a person should possess. </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>My Rating:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>

                <p>Certainly, it was the series of events which led to the petty fight.</p>
<p>I should have also mentioned about the pre lunch mood. So I read the book on pent house terrace and was already feeling exhausted by ~12:30. But I waited till 1:00 and as soon as I went down, things were ready on the table but none of the family members were ready to eat. I waited for arond 5 minutes then I started complaining father "initially it was 12:30, then 12:45, now 1:00. I think till will only go beyond 1:00." I was expressing my need for missing discipline. This, kind of created a bad mood in all the faces. Now father, "If you want you start eating, why are you waiting for us....". All this kind of arguments went on.</p>
<p>And Amma was not happy with the argument and she with her usual sad face came inside and said, "I was ready, I only wanted 5 minutes to hang the wet clothes........". I was fed up and went to table took my plate and started serving myself(Of course with a bad mood face). Then may be because of Amma, everybody came to the table for lunch.</p>
<p>Anyways I have recorded things in the audio about these events for 17 July 2020 recoding.</p>
<p>As I generally, apologize even for the smallest of the events, I was expecting an apology from my sister. But as soon as my knuckle got hurt, for one time she asked me "if anything happened", then after that, she started only to get away from the blame of hurting me. This is what I remember.</p>
<p>Now, I was furious about the way she was trying to evade blame on her. Because of this only I replied in mocking words.</p>
<p>But in the evening discussion, Amma told me that she asked if anything happened only. Amma didn't acknowledge about the way she was trying to evade the guilt on her.</p>
<p>But anyways, Sister was already with her unhappy face and after my night walk, I went to her and apologized with a feeling that I might be wrong.</p>
<p>Anyways as I said yesterday, let's forget about this stupid petty fight.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Okay listen what happened:</p>
<p>I think this is the first test for lord Ganesha to stop me from masturbation because of this anxiety.</p>
<p>The ghee in the vessel was not melted. My sister her highness you know is lazy, but for all the praises that she has been receiving(may be I'm not sure), took the ghee vessel and got ghee in it melted. Now you know a lazy person feels even a very small work a very great one. So as soon as she came back to the table asked me to take hold of the ghee vessel. I thought of taking it, but as it was hot I took the plate on which she can keep the vessel.</p>
<p>But the plate was smaller one, so there are chances that that ghee vessel once place will touch my grip of the plate. She instead of taking the plate for herself and placing on that now started lowering my hand which was catching the plate and in the air. In the process one of my knuckles hit the rice vessel which was already hot.</p>
<p>Reflex in me pulled back my hand. On whole she didn't want a blame on her which I was able to sense through her words and face. And also she only likes praises, no scolding and other things. Also as this was a small thing I also wanted to leave it. But you know only from few days I am writing these posts and will take time before I will become very cool person. Now for the question : "Did anything happen?", I replied: "nothing happened, nothing..." - but what happened was the tone was mocking. Because I was not speaking from my heart.</p>
<p>Soon a fight erupted. But my tone was mocking because she didn't want to hear wrongdoing. She is always like that. Lunch went on silently, she ate very fast or may be very less I don't know. After she completed her lunch, I asked Amma if I was wrong? Now she said that I didn't know how to talk and that is the reason why I'm facing all the problems. To which I replied: "I always want to tell the truth, want transparency. But as soon as I speak truth(what my heart says), everybody is crying and don't even want to listen to me! Now I want to speak something, but I'm speaking of something else because of which I'm unable to convey my words correctly." Tears rolled down her eyes. Amma's reply: "Very good, very good, you are feared of sister, I'm feared of you, etc." But you know she didn't say that everybody in the house are feared of her also. Then father replied to Amma: "I'm feared of you"...........</p>
<p>Now my question to you is:</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">My knuckles got hurt(of course it was very small one). It was because of her laziness this happened. Generally I apologize for even the smallest of the harm(both mentally and physically), sometimes even there is no fault of mine. Should I expect an apology?</p>
<p>My heart says it is a very simple thing, if physically harm was not that much and you wanted to neglect it then the way you spoke should have hurt her and you should apologize her.</p>
<p>But my heart says this should be left.......There is some nullity in my mind as I write this post. Is it just because of burning my hand should I expect a sorry?</p>
<p>NO.........</p>
<p>I'm not expecting any sorry and also I will not apologize because it was a series of things that happened. May I should change my attitude. Try not to say anything mockingly if you can't say it in correct way. I now feel my attitude is only wrong. </p>
<p>Fine I will change it.</p>
<p>Thank you lord Shiva now I don't have any anxiety and anger. I'm cool. But it took me around 1:30 hrs to cool down. With god's blessings this time will only reduce and I will be cool not anger, no anxiety....only love......only happiness.......only cheerfulness..............</p>
<p>This is very silly thing to take into my mind. AP leave it.</p>
<p>To cooldown I generally listen to this music(I have listened to this music and many more while I was writing this post):</p>

<p>Clarification:</p>
<ul>
<li>I loved cooking, but the Paratha was okay.</li>
<li>Prayers were heard.</li>
<li>If I keep my calmness and coolness, then I can bring back all the happiness in my mother's life may be by becoming IAS or by not being angry myself etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to write this quote yesterday itself(Actually I framed this a few days ago):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can't apologize, you can't forgive</p>
<p>If you can't forgive, you can't grow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit 1: 16 July 2020</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can't apologize, you can't forgive</p>
<p>If you can't forgive, you can never forgive yourself</p>
<p>If you can never forgive yourself, you can never forgive others</p>
<p>For the attitude of forgiving is an indication of wisdom, enlightenment, salvation....</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Actually I don't watch porn for hours and hours because it only became a "<em>habit"</em> from end of last december. Also I don't have that much sperm count as apparent from the falling of my dick after first ejaculation. Okay, coming back I regret having this bad habit, but you know it had its own advantages during my GATE exam last month preparation. It will give you some dose of adrenaline which you can help overcome anxiety. But now I'm fighting very hard to get rid of this bloody thing. First thing I did was start cycling back again(of course for fitness also) so that most of my energy is spent in cycling and less amount of energy is left for masturbation. </p>
<p>Now this stupid corona, I am taking many many breaks and with so much of energy your body will only remind you of Julia Anna. Isn't it? What a sexy porn star she is! Her boobs make my dick rise, her seduction and her laugh make my dick rise. Of course these are all manly things which I should experience in my life, but now too far.</p>
<p>Now of course I feel like squeezing the sperms out of my dick watching the M<em>adam</em>ILF!!</p>
<p>And by the way I don't want to blame corona for my porn watching, I should atleast find some other way to use my energy. Maybe as many say, watching porn by me is something of an excuse for some other inner insecurity feeling in me? Or am I one of those scoundrels who don't have control on their senses? I can't answer that for sure, because I wanted to go a trip for so long after my GATE results(which of course was great).</p>
<p>I can say one thing, I respect women to their fullest. But my gut feeling says I will leave this bad habit once Corona is gone. But I'm not sure because I don't know when I will get a chance to travel so that my inner one will forget all the stupid things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neurons that fire together, wire together</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is happening is, during my GATE and other exams preparation(mostly during the end) when ever I used to feel anxiety after mock test score, to continue with the preparation and to feel cheerful I thought of masturbation. Now inner me knows it is a very bad idea so it used to feel more anxiety. So in total:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exam anxiety + Porn anxiety = more anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you know after masturbation, your anxiety levels are very low. Now what happened was, the neurons wired together that whenever I will feel anxiety even if it very small thing I feel like masturbating and vice versa.</p>
<p>You know? I don't feel like masturbating whenever I don't feel anxious, but you know life is after all filled with complete anxieties.</p>
<p>Now as I write, I feel like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To get rid of this bad habit, don't go the straight way. Take another route!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought of masturbating only when I'm not anxious, but what if this will misfire in another way? i.e. may be in future I will feel like masturbating just simply?</p>
<p>I am also thinking of taking help of great lord Ganesha whom I stopped praying from last july.</p>
<p>Holy fuck!! now I understand, when I did my prayers I somehow woke up early, only watched sexy stuff(never masturbated). But after I joined coaching, I completely stopped my prayers. Slowly these two(sleep+porn) bad habits caught hold of me.</p>
<p>Okay from today, I will make a oath that I will pray even if I wake up late. Now I can complete the puzzle, which I will save it for another post because may be with this enlightenment I will stop masturbating for many years to come, because without getting rid of this bad habit, someday there are many chances that this fantasy may slowly develop into a misogyny. I also fear, if this bad habit is not deforested when it is still a plant, I can never be a best administrator.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">For now in my life, masturbation and women are completely different. Masturbation(with aid of porn) is just a cure for my anxiety. I have immense respect for women, their problems.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">I will be honored if god will give me a chance to serve, empower and uplift the women in this country and where ever they face problems for I cannot bear the sufferings.</p>
<p>To be frank with you, as soon as I thought of prayers, my gut feeling says this is the solution I was searching for. Now even if I'm thinking of Julia Ann I don't feel like masturbating. Wow, first good omen. Isn't it?</p>
<p>Okay bye for now.</p>
<p>I thank god for giving this opportunity to live this great life. I thank him for the feeling of love, empathy, compassion which I have towards poor(especially women, old and children). I thank you my god for telling me the real cause of my porn habit which I will certainly utilize to get rid of this bad habit.</p>
<p>I thank you for making me take a break, read books(especially 5AM club book) followed by Anne Frank diary. </p>
<p>Thank you Lord Shiva, Thank you.</p>

<p>May god bless me with this journey. I'm thankful to him. My only prayer is <em>"Please don't trouble my parents &amp; Sister with anything, if you want solution for any problem inflict that upon me. But remember: there shouldn't be any trouble for my family as they cannot take anything which is naive."</em></p>
