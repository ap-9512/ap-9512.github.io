Now while I write this, I'm changing it to Target LBSNAA</p><p>Okay! You already know that from last 3 days I have been questioning god about my purpose for this life. Suddenly just after two days of questioning yesterday morning, I had a dream in which I was getting tensed about ESE exam(in my dream it was to happen when I wake up). Now generally I don't remember my dreams when I wake up. But this dream got somehow registered. May be it is not the purpose for which I was born. But it can for sure be my path to fulfill the purpose.</p><p>It I observe, from February after GATE exam I only did some newspaper reading. But surprisingly the first thing I started with was mechanical engineering optional. When ever I started with another subject(ethics), I felt desolated and was unable to enjoy things completely. Of course it would have been beautiful if I would have initially started with history, geography etc subjects. But I did otherwise. May be because of that I felt desolated.</p><p>I have thinking about this from yesterday. As I'm already done with 75% of the syllabus my feeling is that I can easily do with ESE. Now the questions are:</p><ul><li>Should I go with ESE because I feel it is easy or because I really want to do it?</li><li>I'm unable to answer the above question. But if I'm doing it because it is easy, what is the guarantee that I will not finally stick with GATE as I did last year?</li><li>Okay what after ESE? Will I be satisfied with ESE job, no I will feel like doing CSE again. So why not continue with CSE itself. Even if I fail, I will atleast get experience to try again.</li><li>Should I instead continue with CSE and now do it other way - start with history, geography etc?</li><li>I really enjoyed the CSE journey, but the problem was note making, newspaper which consumed a lot of time. Should I find the mistake I'm doing again and start again?</li><li>CSE for me is of medium toughness, but I know that it requires 100% discipline. The first thing that I cannot stop thinking is how will I manage ill-disciplined family?</li><li>Everything while about to take a decision seems very easy, is ESE decision also the same?</li><li>One reason I didn't like ESE was its prelims paper 1. How will I continue with that syllabus?</li><li>Another thing is ESE only has ~5 months of time. What is the guarantee that I will not feel frustrated during these days and show my anger to the family? Which will make me loose few days and finally I will only settle with GATE!!!!!!!</li><li>Why ESE why not CSE? The only answer I'm hearing is because it is easy and you already have experience of sources, strategy etc.</li><li>One thing is guarantee, attitude of a civil servant is needed for both CSE and ESE. If you are able to do ESE you should be able to do CSE. Then why not do CSE where I can serve people directly and see their happiness?</li></ul><p>Now while I write this blog post, I feel like I have to stick with CSE only. I think this is the best way. I want to go to universal book store and purchase the history, goegraphy etc books and do a restart.</p><p>You know this is the reason I wanted to write a blog post. It will help me make a simple and easy decision.</p><p>So lets state the problems/mistakes I did in first phase:</p><ul><li>‚≠êWaking up late in the morning/over sleep.</li><li>Loosing my calmness even for very simple reasons.</li><li>Getting anxious for number of hours spent of newspaper.</li><li>Not having a clear cut strategy</li><li>Not taking ample amount of break/taking large breaks at once</li><li>üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüFamily</li><li>‚≠êWatching porn/masturbating everyday causing:<ul><li>Mood changes</li><li>No emotional intelligence</li><li>Loss of self-esteem</li><li>Loss of energy</li></ul></li><li>Very large and unbelievable targets for a given day.</li><li>Lack of revision/practice etc.</li><li>No discipline - Actually I want to write about this separately.</li><li>Impatience</li><li>Thinking of becoming a master/pro in one day</li><li>Not able to cope up with uncertainty.</li><li>‚≠ê‚≠êNot enjoying the journey which if enjoyed can be the best journey a person can have on this planet.</li><li>Procrastination because you loose everyday because of large targets and this becomes common for you!</li><li>Unnecessary complaining to Sister about Amma, which will make me remind all her foolish deeds and get furious.¬†</li><li>Over stubbornness</li><li>Wasting time on cooking etc.</li></ul><h2>Discipline</h2><p>According to Amma, if I ask her to give lunch/break at a given time, she feels that I'm treating her like a restaurant cook. Next, most of the uncertainty that I can expect in my life is from my family(obviously, because there is not other way that god can inflict troubles). Continuous complaining about each and every small matter. No set pattern by Amma. She just wants to give up her duties but her feeling is that no body should say a word to her. I can understand that she is tired doing the same job for many decades. But why should she give up her duties now only?¬†</p><p>Anyways the biggest doubt in my mind is, if I start say today, my bet is tomorrow she will create some big trouble in house and disturb whole mood of the house.¬†</p><p class="msg msg--success">Okay anyways, Target LBSNAA!!!</p><p>I will make a strategy in next blog post. This time it will be such that I should not fail!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on Thursday, July 23, 2020</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://ap-9512.github.io/media/website/scales_2696-1.png" loading="lazy" alt="My Conscience"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/authors/my-conscience/" class="invert" rel="author">My Conscience</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ap-9512.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/my-notes-and-review-book-ram.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> My Notes and Review: Book: Ram</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/strategy-target-lbsnaa.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Constitution: Target LBSNAA </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ap-9512.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-07-23T10:32" class="feed__date">Thursday, July 23, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/strategy-target-lbsnaa.html" class="invert">Constitution: Target LBSNAA</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2020 AP-9512</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://ap-9512.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
