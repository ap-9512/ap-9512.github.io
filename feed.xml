                <p>Okay listen what happened:</p>
<p>I think this is the first test for lord Ganesha to stop me from masturbation because of this anxiety.</p>
<p>The ghee in the vessel was not melted. My sister her highness you know is lazy, but for all the praises that she has been receiving(may be I'm not sure), took the ghee vessel and got ghee in it melted. Now you know a lazy person feels even a very small work a very great one. So as soon as she came back to the table asked me to take hold of the ghee vessel. I thought of taking it, but as it was hot I took the plate on which she can keep the vessel.</p>
<p>But the plate was smaller one, so there are chances that that ghee vessel once place will touch my grip of the plate. She instead of taking the plate for herself and placing on that now started lowering my hand which was catching the plate and in the air. In the process one of my knuckles hit the rice vessel which was already hot.</p>
<p>Reflex in me pulled back my hand. On whole she didn't want a blame on her which I was able to sense through her words and face. And also she only likes praises, no scolding and other things. Also as this was a small thing I also wanted to leave it. But you know only from few days I am writing these posts and will take time before I will become very cool person. Now for the question : "Did anything happen?", I replied: "nothing happened, nothing..." - but what happened was the tone was mocking. Because I was not speaking from my heart.</p>
<p>Soon a fight erupted. But my tone was mocking because she didn't want to hear wrongdoing. She is always like that. Lunch went on silently, she ate very fast or may be very less I don't know. After she completed her lunch, I asked Amma if I was wrong? Now she said that I didn't know how to talk and that is the reason why I'm facing all the problems. To which I replied: "I always want to tell the truth, want transparency. But as soon as I speak truth(what my heart says), everybody is crying and don't even want to listen to me! Now I want to speak something, but I'm speaking of something else because of which I'm unable to convey my words correctly." Tears rolled down her eyes. Amma's reply: "Very good, very good, you are feared of sister, I'm feared of you, etc." But you know she didn't say that everybody in the house are feared of her also. Then father replied to Amma: "I'm feared of you"...........</p>
<p>Now my question to you is:</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">My knuckles got hurt(of course it was very small one). It was because of her laziness this happened. Generally I apologize for even the smallest of the harm(both mentally and physically), sometimes even there is no fault of mine. Should I expect an apology?</p>
<p>My heart says it is a very simple thing, if physically harm was not that much and you wanted to neglect it then the way you spoke should have hurt her and you should apologize her.</p>
<p>But my heart says this should be left.......There is some nullity in my mind as I write this post. Is it just because of burning my hand should I expect a sorry?</p>
<p>NO.........</p>
<p>I'm not expecting any sorry and also I will not apologize because it was a series of things that happened. May I should change my attitude. Try not to say anything mockingly if you can't say it in correct way. I now feel my attitude is only wrong.¬†</p>
<p>Fine I will change it.</p>
<p>Thank you lord Shiva now I don't have any anxiety and anger. I'm cool. But it took me around 1:30 hrs to cool down. With god's blessings this time will only reduce and I will be cool not anger, no anxiety....only love......only happiness.......only cheerfulness..............</p>
<p>This is very silly thing to take into my mind. AP leave it.</p>
<p>To cooldown I generally listen to this music(I have listened to this music and many more while I was writing this post):</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>Actually I don't watch porn for hours and hours because it only became a "<em>habit"</em> from end of last december. Also I don't have that much sperm count as apparent from the falling of my dick after first ejaculation. Okay, coming back I regret having this bad habit, but you know it had its own advantages during my GATE exam last month preparation. It will give you some dose of adrenaline which you can help overcome anxiety. But now I'm fighting very hard to get rid of this bloody thing. First thing I did was start cycling back again(of course for fitness also) so that most of my energy is spent in cycling and less amount of energy is left for masturbation.¬†</p>
<p>Now this stupid corona, I am taking many many breaks and with so much of energy your body will only remind you of Julia Anna. Isn't it? What a sexy porn star she is! Her boobs make my dick rise, her seduction and her laugh make my dick rise. Of course these are all manly things which I should experience in my life, but now too far.</p>
<p>Now of course I feel like squeezing the sperms out of my dick watching the M<em>adam</em>ILF!!</p>
<p>And by the way I don't want to blame corona for my porn watching, I should atleast find some other way to use my energy. Maybe as many say, watching porn by me is something of an excuse for some other inner insecurity feeling in me? Or am I one of those scoundrels who don't have control on their senses? I can't answer that for sure, because I wanted to go a trip for so long after my GATE results(which of course was great).</p>
<p>I can say one thing, I respect women to their fullest. But my gut feeling says I will leave this bad habit once Corona is gone. But I'm not sure because I don't know when I will get a chance to travel so that my inner one will forget all the stupid things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neurons that fire together, wire together</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is happening is, during my GATE and other exams preparation(mostly during the end) when ever I used to feel anxiety after mock test score, to continue with the preparation and to feel cheerful I thought of masturbation. Now inner me knows it is a very bad idea so it used to feel more anxiety. So in total:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exam anxiety + Porn anxiety = more anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you know after masturbation, your anxiety levels are very low. Now what happened was, the neurons wired together that whenever I will feel anxiety even if it very small thing I feel like masturbating and vice versa.</p>
<p>You know? I don't feel like masturbating whenever I don't feel anxious, but you know life is after all filled with complete anxieties.</p>
<p>Now as I write, I feel like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To get rid of this bad habit, don't go the straight way. Take another route!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought of masturbating only when I'm not anxious, but what if this will misfire in another way? i.e. may be in future I will feel like masturbating just simply?</p>
<p>I am also thinking of taking help of great lord Ganesha whom I stopped praying from last july.</p>
<p>Holy fuck!! now I understand, when I did my prayers I somehow woke up early, only watched sexy stuff(never masturbated). But after I joined coaching, I completely stopped my prayers. Slowly these two(sleep+porn) bad habits caught hold of me.</p>
<p>Okay from today, I will make a oath that I will pray even if I wake up late. Now I can complete the puzzle, which I will save it for another post because may be with this enlightenment I will stop masturbating for many years to come, because without getting rid of this bad habit, someday there are many chances that this fantasy may slowly develop into a misogyny. I also fear, if this bad habit is not deforested when it is still a plant, I can never be a best administrator.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">For now in my life, masturbation and women are completely different. Masturbation(with aid of porn) is just a cure for my anxiety. I have immense respect for women, their problems.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">I will be honored if god will give me a chance to serve, empower and uplift the women in this country and where ever they face problems for I cannot bear the sufferings.</p>
<p>To be frank with you, as soon as I thought of prayers, my gut feeling says this is the solution I was searching for. Now even if I'm thinking of Julia Ann I don't feel like masturbating. Wow, first good omen. Isn't it?</p>
<p>Okay bye for now.</p>
<p>I thank god for giving this opportunity to live this great life. I thank him for the feeling of love, empathy, compassion which I have towards poor(especially women, old and children). I thank you my god for telling me the real cause of my porn habit which I will certainly utilize to get rid of this bad habit.</p>
<p>I thank you for making me take a break, read books(especially 5AM club book) followed by Anne Frank diary.¬†</p>
<p>Thank you Lord Shiva, Thank you.</p>

<p>I've tested this concept and it only works on Google chrome, Mozilla!</p>
<p>You might ask me why I'm checking browser compatibility if the website is not for general public: The answer is "Yes, it is not for public for now! But, in future if I feel like publishing the website, I cannot simply keep on editing the posts for ever!!"</p>

<p>As this is an anonymous website, I will be true to the best of my <em>"conscience".</em></p>
<p>Okay let's have a head-start.¬†</p>
<p>If I feel like editing this one, then I will add a new post, as internet is unlimited.</p>
<p>Actually in the past I used to write all my entries on a wordpress blog, but now as the files I will upload will be audio files and the size is limited on wordpress to approx 5GB, I have thought of this. And of course, wordpress website that I created is not published and it has my name. So for now, till I achieve my greatness I cannot publish that website and also this website will be search engine <em>"unfriendly!!</em>üòâ<em>"</em></p>
<p>May God bless me with this activity, help me with this activity.</p>
<p>Edit 1: 16 Jul 2016</p>
<p>As I have made the audio part private repo, I'm not fearful anymore and so think the website can be published. But I'm not going to care for the SEO part(I'm not doing this for money, it is for cooling myself down, expressing my thoughts......).</p>
