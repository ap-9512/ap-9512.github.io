My sister her highness you know is lazy, but for all the praises that she has been receiving(may be I'm not sure), took the ghee vessel and got ghee in it melted. Now you know a lazy person feels even a very small work a very great one. So as soon as she came back to the table asked me to take hold of the ghee vessel. I thought of taking it, but as it was hot I took the plate on which she can keep the vessel.</p><p>But the plate was smaller one, so there are chances that that ghee vessel once place will touch my grip of the plate. She instead of taking the plate for herself and placing on that now started lowering my hand which was catching the plate and in the air. In the process one of my knuckles hit the rice vessel which was already hot.</p><p>Reflex in me pulled back my hand. On whole she didn't want a blame on her which I was able to sense through her words and face. And also she only likes praises, no scolding and other things. Also as this was a small thing I also wanted to leave it. But you know only from few days I am writing these posts and will take time before I will become very cool person. Now for the question : "Did anything happen?", I replied: "nothing happened, nothing..." - but what happened was the tone was mocking. Because I was not speaking from my heart.</p><p>Soon a fight erupted. But my tone was mocking because she didn't want to hear wrongdoing. She is always like that. Lunch went on silently, she ate very fast or may be very less I don't know. After she completed her lunch, I asked Amma if I was wrong? Now she said that I didn't know how to talk and that is the reason why I'm facing all the problems. To which I replied: "I always want to tell the truth, want transparency. But as soon as I speak truth(what my heart says), everybody is crying and don't even want to listen to me! Now I want to speak something, but I'm speaking of something else because of which I'm unable to convey my words correctly." Tears rolled down her eyes. Amma's reply: "Very good, very good, you are feared of sister, I'm feared of you, etc." But you know she didn't say that everybody in the house are feared of her also. Then father replied to Amma: "I'm feared of you"...........</p><p>Now my question to you is:</p><p class="msg msg--info">My knuckles got hurt(of course it was very small one). It was because of her laziness this happened. Generally I apologize for even the smallest of the harm(both mentally and physically), sometimes even there is no fault of mine. Should I expect an apology?</p><p>My heart says it is a very simple thing, if physically harm was not that much and you wanted to neglect it then the way you spoke should have hurt her and you should apologize her.</p><p>But my heart says this should be left.......There is some nullity in my mind as I write this post. Is it just because of burning my hand should I expect a sorry?</p><p>NO.........</p><p>I'm not expecting any sorry and also I will not apologize because it was a series of things that happened. May I should change my attitude. Try not to say anything mockingly if you can't say it in correct way. I now feel my attitude is only wrong.Â </p><p>Fine I will change it.</p><p>Thank you lord Shiva now I don't have any anxiety and anger. I'm cool.</p><p>This is very silly thing to take into my mind. AP leave it.</p><p>To cooldown I generally listen to this music(I have listened to this music and many more while I was writing this post):</p><p></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/38420037&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe></div><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on Thursday, July 16, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/fight/">fight</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://ap-9512.github.io/media/website/scales_2696-1.png" loading="lazy" alt="AP"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/authors/ap/" class="invert" rel="author">AP</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ap-9512.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/16-july-2020.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> 16 July 2020</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2020 AP-9512</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://ap-9512.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
