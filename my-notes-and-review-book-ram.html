You will understand that there are many broken links in colloquial Ramayan. I didn't feel boring at all. You will understand that, evil existed even in those times. I'm eager to read the next book in the sequel. If you are dedicated, the book should only take around 2 days to read.</p><h2>My notes:</h2><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success dropcap">Lord Brahma, the Creator, one of the greatest scientists ever. He was credited with many inventions upon which the Vedic way of life had been built. His disciples lived by the code he’d established: relentless pursuit of knowledge and selfless service to society. They had, over the years, evolved into the tribe of Brahma, or Brahmins.</p></blockquote><p>This statement gives idea about the birth of Brahmin Caste. It should be noted that there is nothing special about initial Brahmins. It seems like they have come together because of their interest in knowledge. <em>It is not at all by their birth.</em></p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">Periodically, when a way of life became inefficient, corrupt or fanatical, a new leader emerged, who guided his people to an improved social order. <em>Vishnu was an ancient title accorded to the greatest of leaders, idolised as the Propagators of Good. The Vishnus were worshipped like Gods.</em><br><br></p></blockquote><p>So <em>Ekam or One God</em> sends a person on this planet who brings radical changes to corrupted lifestyles of people.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">It was well known that the moon shone with the reflected light of the sun. Poetically, the sun was the face and the moon its reflection;</p></blockquote><p>it tells about the scientific knowledge of ancient Indians.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">That names guided destiny was an ancient belief.</p><p class="msg msg--success">Parents chose the names of their children with care. A name, in a sense, became an aspiration, swadharma, individual dharma, for the child.</p></blockquote><p>So check for the meaning of your name. May be god has created you for that purpose.😄 Atleast act according your name. For example, my name meaning is: The one who doesn't return without a victory. So I should follow the quotation: "Be like a postage stamp, stick to one thing until you get there." Isn't it?</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">In keeping with tradition, the princes had been accorded gurukul names: Ram was called Sudas, Bharat became Vasu, Lakshman was Paurav, and Shatrughan, Nalatardak.</p></blockquote><p>This is just for information.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">‘Truth. Duty. Honour,’ said Ram,<br>‘Live free or die,’ said Bharat,</p></blockquote><p>This highlights Lord Ram's attitude towards Laws. While Bharat is for liberal policies.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">‘Not revealing the truth is lying, isn’t it, Guruji?’ ‘No, it isn’t. Sometimes, truth causes pain and suffering. At such times, silence is preferred. In fact, there may be times when a white lie, or even an outright lie, could actually lead to a good outcome. Lying may save someone’s life. Lying may bring one into a position of authority, which in turn may result in an opportunity to do good. Would you still advocate not lying? It may well be said that a true leader loves his people more than he loves his own soul. There would be no doubt in the mind of such a leader. He would lie for the good of his people.’</p><p class="msg msg--success"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Wisdom lies in moderation, in balance. If you lie to save an innocent person from some bandits, is that wrong?</em></span></p><p class="msg msg--success">Your habit of speaking the truth is good. But what is your reason for it? Is it because you believe it’s the lawful thing to do? Or, is it because this incident has made you fear lying?’</p></blockquote><p>This is the conversation between Ram and his Guru about truth. Enlightening isn't it?</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">‘Nobody in Ayodhya gives two hoots about the law, Dada! We are a civilization in an advanced state of decay. We’re the most hypocritical people on earth. We criticize corruption in others, but are blind to our own dishonesty. We hate others who do wrong and commit crimes, blithely ignoring our own misdeeds, big and small. We vehemently blame Raavan for all our ills, refusing to acknowledge that we created the mess we find ourselves in.’</p><p class="msg msg--success">‘This attitude is basic human nature. We’d rather look outward and blame others for the ills that befall us than point the finger at ourselves. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. We need a king who can create systems with which one can harness even selfish human nature for the betterment of society.’</p></blockquote><p>After the battle of Karchappa, the kingdom of Ayodhya becomes very weak financially. This is mainly because of Raavan's aggressive trade policies causing losses among people. Everybody blames Raavan for his trade policies, forgetting that Ayodhya lost a war because of hasty decisions. This victory of Raavan has made him unquestionable.</p><p>So the discussion above is <strong>"We blame someone else for our mistakes and misfortunes."</strong></p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>There’s a thin line that separates courage from stupidity.</em></span>’</p><p class="msg msg--success">‘And that line is only visible in retrospect, my friend. If I’m successful, people will call me brave. If I fail, I will be called foolish. Let me do what I think is right. I’ll leave the verdict to the future.’</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success"> you compromise the prospects of the strong, and lean too much towards the interests of the weak, then your society itself goes into decline.</p></blockquote><p>I think this is the biggest problem with communist ideology.</p><p>You should leave the strong in their own way until they don't interfere with your efforts to uplift the weak.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">‘A real leader doesn’t choose to lead only the deserving.</p><p class="msg msg--success">He will, instead, inspire his people into becoming the best that they are capable of.</p><p class="msg msg--success">A real leader will not defend a monster, but convert that demon into a God; tap into the God that dwells within even him.</p><p class="msg msg--success">He takes upon himself the burden of dharma sankat, but he ensures that his people become better human beings.’<br><br></p></blockquote><p>Ram says the above after his victory with Raavan at Mithila. He knows that if Asurastra is used then he will be banished for 14 years. But to save people, he should use Asurastra. So he takes the burden of living a hermit life for the sake of people.</p><p>So a real leader will do <em><strong>Selfless</strong></em> service for his people. He takes upon as much fault on himself to make their lives better.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">Sometimes wrath is required to deliver justice. But the strange thing about anger is that it is like fire; the more you feed it, the more it grows. It takes a lot of wisdom to know when to let anger go.<br><br></p></blockquote><p>This is <em>the problem with using violent methods for solution</em>. it is like a fire, you will need more of it, even after your main purpose is completed. </p><p>This is also highlighted by <em>Tales of Man Singh - Kenneth Anderson.</em> He says that Man Singh has started to save weaker sections from stronger section. But as he used violent methods, he keeps on killing many many people. At the end he is classified as murderer but the society doesn't change at large. There are many reasons for this:</p><ul><li>May be people have thought that Man Singh was a rumor.</li><li>A covert gang cannot create its own law for a vast country like India.</li><li>Stronger sections always find a loop hole in everything. I think Man Singh was trying to destroy the effect leaving the cause on its own.</li></ul><hr><blockquote><p> </p></blockquote></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on Tuesday, July 21, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/book/">book</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://ap-9512.github.io/media/website/scales_2696-1.png" loading="lazy" alt="My Conscience"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/authors/my-conscience/" class="invert" rel="author">My Conscience</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ap-9512.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/my-notes-and-review-book-the-greatest-miracle-in-the-world.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> My notes and review:Book: The Greatest Miracle in the world</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-07-20T20:19" class="feed__date">Monday, July 20, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/my-notes-and-review-book-the-greatest-miracle-in-the-world.html" class="invert">My notes and review:Book: The Greatest Miracle in the world</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-07-17T17:17" class="feed__date">Friday, July 17, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/book-my-thoughts-review-return-to-me.html" class="invert">Book: My thoughts + Review: Return to me</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2020 AP-9512</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://ap-9512.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
