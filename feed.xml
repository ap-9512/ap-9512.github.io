<p>This audio file was one of my favorite music.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not the owner of this file but I am not able to post the link here because I only have a download and forgot from where I've downloaded this.</p>
<p><audio loading="lazy" controls="controls">
  <source src="https://github.com/ap-9512/audio/blob/master/hip-hop-beat.mp3?raw=true" type="audio/mp3" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>

<p>As this is an anonymous website, I will be true to the best of my <em>"conscience".</em></p>
<p>Okay let's have a head-start.Â </p>
<p>If I feel like editing this one, then I will add a new post, as internet is unlimited.</p>
<p>Actually in the past I used to write all my entries on a wordpress blog, but now as the files I will upload will be audio files and the size is limited on wordpress to approx 5GB, I have thought of this. And of course, wordpress website that I created is not published and it has my name. So for now, till I achieve my greatness I cannot publish that website and also this website will be search engine <em>"unfriendly!!</em>ðŸ˜‰<em>"</em></p>
<p>May God bless me with this activity, help me with this activity.</p>
