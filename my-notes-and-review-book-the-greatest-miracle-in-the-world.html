But I procrastinated and so might miss some points(my thoughts) that I felt about making notes of....</p><p class="msg msg--success"><strong>My Review:¬†</strong>A good motivating book. The book introduces the success formula using a story format. The main concept is only at the end. You will have to read the given chapter for 100 days without break and with full heart. I am still on third day and will write an update here, once I complete 100 days. It is expected that there will be a change in the behavior and your attitude.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">My Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5)</p><p>The following are my notes/quotation which I really liked:</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">"The beginning of pride is in heaven. The continuance of pride is on earth. The end of pride is in hell."</p></blockquote><p>Definition of pride: <em>a feeling or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements, the achievements of those with whom one is closely associated, or from qualities or possessions that are widely admired.</em></p><p>Definition itself says everything. I don't have many words to add.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">Most humans, in varying degrees, are already dead. In one way or another they have lost their dreams, their ambitions, their desire for a better life. They have surrendered their fight for self-esteem and they have compromised their great potential. They have settled for a life of mediocrity, days of despair and nights of tears. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>They are no more than living deaths</em></span> confined to cemeteries of their choice. Yet they need not remain in that state. They can be resurrected from their sorry condition. They can each perform the greatest miracle in the world. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>They can each come back from the dead... and in those books are the simple secrets, techniques, and methods</em></span> which they can still apply to their own lives to become anything they wish to be and to attain all the true riches of life."</p></blockquote><p>The author emphasizes book reading as a habit to reach success. In some sense, he is talking about books like Elliot's five foot collection. He encourages us to read books that will make you think, inculcate values. But he also says that he has already read most of the great books and found that they all teach the same thing albeit in different ways.¬†</p><p>He says that today people are forgetting their dreams ambitions etc. which have driven our life during our childhood. Instead we are living in a safe zone and have given up our ambitions. This is creating the whole problems. We are living like dead without any new hope etc.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>most of us build prisons for ourselves</em></span> and after we occupy them for a period of time <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>we become accustomed to their walls and accept the false premise that we are incarcerated for life</em></span>. As soon as that belief takes hold of us we abandon hope of ever doing more with our lives and of ever giving our dreams a chance to be fulfilled. We become puppets and begin to suffer living deaths. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>It may be praiseworthy and noble to sacrifice your life to a cause</em></span> or a business or the happiness of others, but if you are miserable and unfulfilled in that lifestyle, and know it, then to remain in it is a hypocrisy, a lie, and a rejection of the faith placed in you by your creator.</p></blockquote><p>He says, that we are blaming our situation/series of events/god for our bad luck. We donot understand that this was our fault. We forget that it was we whole have tried to create this wall in the name of future security. As time passes we get accustomed to the fate we have created and live like dead.</p><p>He says that instead of living a miserable life(even if you are financially successful), live a life which keeps us happy. We should live for a cause which will make our life a mark in history. Live for your ambition, childhood dream etc. We should start living for the purpose for which the creator has created us. Don't live in a lie, comparing your riches with a poor(may be he is more happy!), or comparing your literacy with an illiterate(may be he has more good moral values than yours.). It is better to live a life which will help uplift somebody's life for that can give you immense happiness which not even earning millions of dollars. Because we are humans and have evolved by living in a society. A smile in other person's face will make you more happy than million dollars in your bank account.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">'The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, and a hell of heaven.'</p><hr><p class="msg msg--success">our mind is the greatest creation on earth and it can generate the most sublime happiness for its owner‚Äîor it can destroy him. Yet, although we have been given the secret of how to control it, for our happiness and benefit, we still function completely ignorant of its potential, like the most stupid of animals.</p></blockquote><p>The way we perceive this world depends on how we see it. if you see yourself in a hell, then even heaven will look like hellüòÇ. We should be open and broad minded. We should avoid prejudice on every topic. Stop complaining.¬†</p><p>The best way to keep make yourself in heaven is to first de-clutter yourself. Do one thing at a time. This is my personal experience. For example, while reading a wikipedia article if I start opening all the hyperlinks, then at the end the overwhelming information makes me feel exhausted and at the end I will only have superficial knowledge about the main topic I wanted to read. Because our cognitive capacity is limited. Use it wisely.</p><p>Start to forgive<br>Start to believe god is with you<br>Start to beieve what ever is happening is for your good<br>Don't forget to take calculated risks......</p><p>Every person has his time. You should be patient. When time is ripe, when you are ready to serve your purpose, sometimes unknowingly you will be pushed by god to serve your purpose and make this world a beautiful place.</p><p>The way think, the way it will happen. So start being optimistic.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">while we are all different, each unique in his or her own way, our lack of self-esteem which produced o<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ur failure is a universal sickness always originating from the complex of either anxiety, guilt, or inferiority</span></em>... the three standard emotional problems recognized by most students of psychiatry.</p></blockquote><p>Everybody has a unique purpose in this world. But we don't believe in that. We can do what ever can be done by any person on this planet. We can do what Jeff Bezos can do, we can do what Bill Gates can do.... We don't believe it because we are anxious(because of negative thoughts, fear of any harm, safety offered by safe zone. In sum, we are first of all feared of any new thing happening in our life.), guilt(because we continue to live in our past. We are not able to forgive ourselves. Of course regretting the past is good. But we should understand that once we have learnt the lesson, we should be steadfast not to repeat it. Everybody in life makes a mistake. There is no need to continue to live in past just because you have done/experienced something wrong. First thing you have to understand is to forgive others, forgive yourself. For this start with an apology keeping aside your pride!), inferiority(because you have failed in the past doesn't mean you shouldn't try again. First check the cause for your failure. Mostly the failure is because you have not believed yourself "<em>completely</em>" that you can do the task. This led to you only applying partial of yourself. The other reason is surrounding yourself with foolish and pessimistic people who don't believe in you or your ideology. Don't worry start afresh, believing completely yourself, surrounding yourself with <em>"only few"</em> optimistic people who believe in you and your ideology, have patience, perseverance. Dedicate yourself completely.)</p><p><strong>And don't copy or imitate anyone. Do it your own way. If you solve your problem with some other's strategy it will not work and you will fail. You will be writing a different(difficult) answer for a easy question.</strong></p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">"One of the saddest things in life is that the only thing we can do for eight hours a day, day after day, is work. We can't eat for eight hours a day, nor drink for eight hours a day, nor make love for eight hours a day-all we can do for eight hours is work. Which is the reason why man makes himself and everybody else so miserable and unhappy."</p></blockquote><p>This quote applies to a person who has committed himself/herself to a work s/he dislikes.¬† If you are not happy with your work, just leave it. Do something that you like. Become a great person in it. There is no work in this world like it is unworthy of doing. In every sphere we will always see a legend.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">experience was usually an overrated quality.</p><p class="msg msg--success">"We should be careful to get out of an experience all the wisdom that is in it... not like the cat that sits down on a hot stove lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove lid again... and that is well... but also, she will never sit down on a cold one, anymore."</p></blockquote><p>In my opinion, the above quote says: experience is something which we can gain in many ways. There is no need to do a job just because you will gain experience. Instead strive for wisdom. If you want to gain experience(in the job that you love to do) for example on how to serve people, you can do it in many ways: start an NGO, become IAS, become Chief Minister, become Prime Minister.... Every path is different but you will learn a lot. Choose the path that you are comfortable with. And remember all the paths converge at the end depending upon your effort.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">no person ever had a defect that was not really a potential benefit rather than an adversity...</p><p class="msg msg--success">a handsome stag admired his horns and hated his ugly feet. But one day, a hunter came and the stag's ugly feet enabled him to flee to safety. Later, his beautiful horns became caught in the thicket and before he could escape he was shot.</p></blockquote><p>We have already discussed this in the review of book: Return to me: <a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/book-my-thoughts-review-return-to-me.html" title="like to review of book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Every one of us has things about us that aren‚Äôt perfect‚Äîit‚Äôs just that yours is a little more noticeable than ours."</a></p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">"I was taught that <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">everything is attainable if you're prepared to give up, to sacrifice, to get it.</span></em> Whatever you want to do, you can do it, if you want to do it badly enough... and I do believe that. I believe that if I wanted to run a mile in four minutes I could do it. I would have to give up everything else in life, but I could run a mile in four minutes. I believe that if a man wanted to walk on water and was prepared to give up everything else in life, he could do that."<br><br></p></blockquote><p>Work with passion. Give your 100%. There is nothing in this world that you cannot achieve(at least you can achieve everthing which someone has already achieved). For example: Benjamin Franklin in his autobiography says that he used to open his printing press early even before most people in the city woke up, and closed after many were asleep. <strong>This is called as dedication</strong>. Work hard and dedicate yourself. You will get everything in your life. Just time matters.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">Norman Vincent Peale once said that the only time he found people with no problems was when he walked through a cemetery.</p></blockquote><p>Understand that you are not the only person with problems. Everybody has his/her own set of problems. Only a person who fails complain about their problems. A successful person never even thinks about his problem as a problem itself. S/he sees it as an opportunity. For example, if you are building house and some one who is jealous of you tries to vandalize your house by hurling stones. A successful person takes those stones and uses it in construction. The person who is throwing the stone at the end should have financed the construction of your house.</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">there is a strong possibility that several planetary positions, when they occur, may exert some sort of immeasurable force that effects our actions in groups, so that sometime they make us fight, sometime they make us love, sometime they make us write and paint and compose... and all the while we think we are doing these and other things solely for rational reasons. We may all be puppets on a string but we must learn what controls that string, out there, and then cut it, otherwise we will never reach our full potential nor will we ever regain our self-esteem.</p></blockquote><p>In essence, don't believe in astrology or other devil stuff. Because it is a double edged sword. Instead believe in yourself. <strong>Find the cause for your failure, not a scrape goat for your failure.¬†</strong>There is something that is stopping you from success:¬†<strong>Guilt? Inferiority? Anxiety?....</strong> Just find out, stop it from influencing you. Success will be yours.</p><p>Just believe: <em><strong>"god is with you."</strong></em></p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">"Nothing is more disgraceful than that an old man should have nothing to show to prove that he has lived long, except his years."<br><br></p></blockquote><p>Live your life such that people are ready to write books about you, make movies about you, follow you.... Make history. Live like you have lived your life not your days.</p><p>"While you die, you should feel satisfied that you have given 100% of what you are capable of. Leave rest to history, it will record your name"</p><hr><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">'The God Memorandum' is only your ticket to a new life. It will do nothing for you unless you open your mind and your heart to receive it. By itself it will move you not one inch in any direction. The means of transportation, and the power to break your inertia, must be generated by forces long dormant but still alive within you.</p></blockquote><p>Now at the end, author gives tells us the synopsis of most of the great books. He presents it in the form of God's memorandum. He tells us:</p><ol><li>First, mark this day upon your calendar. Then, count forward one hundred days and mark that day.<br><ul><li>My 100<sup>th</sup> day falls on October 25 2020.</li></ul></li><li>Create some amulet and wear it such that it is visible. It should continuously remind you about the God's memorandum and its values for next 100 days. it should remind you that you are progressing in your life. You are going to become a different and great person by the end of 100 days.<ul><li>As of writing I haven't created anything of that sorts. May be I should think of something of that sorts. I will update as soon as I do so.</li><li>Suggestion of author is to use a paper pin and a waste cloth(possessions of a rag picker) as your amulet.</li></ul></li><li>Do not, under any conditions, divulge the meaning of your amulet to those who may inquire during your hundred-day mission.<br><ul><li>I think this will help you not get discouraged by fools and their propaganda.¬†</li><li>It can also be like: some curious people will ask about this everyday until they get the answer. May be this kind of questioning will be a constant reminder for you.</li></ul></li><li>Read 'The God Memorandum' before you retire, each night, for one hundred nights... and then sleep in peace, Let no reason or excuse force you to forego the reading for even one night.¬†</li></ol><blockquote><p class="msg msg--success">By the hundredth day... you will be a living miracle... a new person...</p></blockquote><p>After you experience change in you, only after[100 days] you experience change you can become another rag picker(A person who finds scrap, here scrap refers to people who are living dead) and share this philosophy. But be careful to share this philosophy to only a person who will for sure listen to you. Otherwise they might simply make fun of you and discourage you.</p><p>And do it only with love and compassion.</p><hr><p>¬†</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on Tuesday, July 21, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/book/">book</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://ap-9512.github.io/media/website/scales_2696-1.png" loading="lazy" alt="My Conscience"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/authors/my-conscience/" class="invert" rel="author">My Conscience</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ap-9512.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/book-my-thoughts-review-return-to-me.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Book: My thoughts + Review: Return to me</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2020 AP-9512</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://ap-9512.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
