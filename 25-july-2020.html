I checked all around the house if there was any intruder. Then I also went outside walked up terrace to see if the pent house was also safe. Everything was safe, but one thing that I observed was that not just dogs around our house, but elsewhere and birds were also doing sounds. I thought some natural disaster was about to happen.</p><p>But still I went back to sleep, changing my alarm to 6:00am. i woke up at 8:10 a.m.</p><p>Now today, I will not do masturbation! My target is to read book only. Stay focused. Write positive affirmations I have to read everyday morning.</p><p>Till now, I have completed newspaper part.</p><p>One thing I wanted to mention is that my left eye was twitching from yesterday continuously. Just now I've searched on internet, there are many scientific reasons for that. One of them is stress for eyes. This can be the reason because, i have been using computer for many days continuously + started reading newspaper which has small font etc.</p><p>Anyways one more point is, Amma and Nanna went to flat to clean it so that we can handover the flat to the up coming tenants(our relatives only!).</p><p>Now that I know the scientific reason for twitching I'm cool, happy and not anxious anymore.</p><p>Om Namah Sivayah</p><p>To Lord Shiva</p><p>From: AP</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on Saturday, July 25, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/day/">day</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://ap-9512.github.io/media/website/scales_2696-1.png" loading="lazy" alt="My Conscience"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/authors/my-conscience/" class="invert" rel="author">My Conscience</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ap-9512.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/24-july-2020.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> 24 July 2020</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-07-24T10:32" class="feed__date">Friday, July 24, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/24-july-2020.html" class="invert">24 July 2020</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-07-17T16:03" class="feed__date">Friday, July 17, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/17-july-2020.html" class="invert">17 July 2020</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-07-16T09:52" class="feed__date">Thursday, July 16, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://ap-9512.github.io/16-july-2020.html" class="invert">16 July 2020</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright 2020 AP-9512</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://ap-9512.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
