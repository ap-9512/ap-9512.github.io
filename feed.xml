                <p>So there you go:</p>
<p>This audio file was one of my favorite music.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not the owner of this file but I am not able to post the link here because I only have a download and forgot from where I've downloaded this.</p>
<p><audio loading="lazy" controls="controls">
  <source src="https://github.com/ap-9512/audio/blob/master/hip-hop-beat.mp3?raw=true" type="audio/mp4" />
Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>
<p>So lets see if this will work.</p>
<p>I am very excited!!</p>
<p>Thank you god for helping me with this concept. üòä</p>
<h2>Okay my learnings:</h2>
<p>I've tested this concept and it only works on Google chrome, Mozilla!</p>
<p>You might ask me why I'm checking browser compatibility if the website is not for general public: The answer is "Yes, it is not for public for now! But, in future if I feel like publishing the website, I cannot simply keep on editing the posts for ever!!"</p>
<p>And by the way I have tried opening this website preview on edge and the whole website itself is dirty, how can I expect it to play my audio file??üòÅ</p>

<p>As this is an anonymous website, I will be true to the best of my <em>"conscience".</em></p>
<p>Okay let's have a head-start.¬†</p>
<p>If I feel like editing this one, then I will add a new post, as internet is unlimited.</p>
<p>Actually in the past I used to write all my entries on a wordpress blog, but now as the files I will upload will be audio files and the size is limited on wordpress to approx 5GB, I have thought of this. And of course, wordpress website that I created is not published and it has my name. So for now, till I achieve my greatness I cannot publish that website and also this website will be search engine <em>"unfriendly!!</em>üòâ<em>"</em></p>
<p>May God bless me with this activity, help me with this activity.</p>
