            <p>Actually I don't watch porn for hours and hours because it only became a "<em>habit"</em> from end of last december. Also I don't have that much sperm count as apparent from the falling of my dick after first ejaculation. Okay, coming back I regret having this bad habit, but you know it had its own advantages during my GATE exam last month preparation. It will give you some dose of adrenaline which you can help overcome anxiety. But now I'm fighting very hard to get rid of this bloody thing. First thing I did was start cycling back again(of course for fitness also) so that most of my energy is spent in cycling and less amount of energy is left for masturbation.Â </p>
<p>Now this stupid corona, I am taking many many breaks and with so much of energy your body will only remind you of Julia Anna. Isn't it? What a sexy porn star she is! Her boobs make my dick rise, her seduction and her laugh make my dick rise. Of course these are all manly things which I should experience in my life, but now too far.</p>
<p>Now of course I feel like squeezing the sperms out of my dick watching the M<em>adam</em>ILF!!</p>
<p>And by the way I don't want to blame corona for my porn watching, I should atleast find some other way to use my energy. Maybe as many say, watching porn by me is something of an excuse for some other inner insecurity feeling in me? Or am I one of those scoundrels who don't have control on their senses? I can't answer that for sure, because I wanted to go a trip for so long after my GATE results(which of course was great).</p>
<p>I can say one thing, I respect women to their fullest. But my gut feeling says I will leave this bad habit once Corona is gone. But I'm not sure because I don't know when I will get a chance to travel so that my inner one will forget all the stupid things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neurons that fire together, wire together</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is happening is, during my GATE and other exams preparation(mostly during the end) when ever I used to feel anxiety after mock test score, to continue with the preparation and to feel cheerful I thought of masturbation. Now inner me knows it is a very bad idea so it used to feel more anxiety. So in total:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exam anxiety + Porn anxiety = more anxiety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you know after masturbation, your anxiety levels are very low. Now what happened was, the neurons wired together that whenever I will feel anxiety even if it very small thing I feel like masturbating and vice versa.</p>
<p>You know? I don't feel like masturbating whenever I don't feel anxious, but you know life is after all filled with complete anxieties.</p>
<p>Now as I write, I feel like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To get rid of this bad habit, don't go the straight way. Take another route!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought of masturbating only when I'm not anxious, but what if this will misfire in another way? i.e. may be in future I will feel like masturbating just simply?</p>
<p>I am also thinking of taking help of great lord Ganesha whom I stopped praying from last july.</p>
<p>Holy fuck!! now I understand, when I did my prayers I somehow woke up early, only watched sexy stuff(never masturbated). But after I joined coaching, I completely stopped my prayers. Slowly these two(sleep+porn) bad habits caught hold of me.</p>
<p>Okay from today, I will make a oath that I will pray even if I wake up late. Now I can complete the puzzle, which I will save it for another post because may be with this enlightenment I will stop masturbating for many years to come, because without getting rid of this bad habit, someday there are many chances that this fantasy may slowly develop into a misogyny. I also fear, if this bad habit is not deforested when it is still a plant, I can never be a best administrator.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">For now in my life, masturbation and women are completely different. Masturbation(with aid of porn) is just a cure for my anxiety. I have immense respect for women, their problems.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">I will be honored if god will give me a chance to serve, empower and uplift the women in this country and where ever they face problems for I cannot bear the sufferings.</p>
<p>To be frank with you, as soon as I thought of prayers, my gut feeling says this is the solution I was searching for. Now even if I'm thinking of Julia Ann I don't feel like masturbating. Wow, first good omen. Isn't it?</p>
<p>Okay bye for now.</p>
<p>I thank god for giving this opportunity to live this great life. I thank him for the feeling of love, empathy, compassion which I have towards poor(especially women, old and children). I thank you my god for telling me the real cause of my porn habit which I will certainly utilize to get rid of this bad habit.</p>
<p>I thank you for making me take a break, read books(especially 5AM club book) followed by Anne Frank diary.Â </p>
<p>Thank you Lord Shiva, Thank you.</p>
