            <title>My Notes and Review: Book: Ram - My Journal </title>
        <meta name="description" content="Author: Amish TripathiMy Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐(5/5)My Review: This book, will show you Ramayan with a complete new and interesting picture. You will understand that there are many broken links in colloquial Ramayan. I didn't feel boring at all. You will understand that, evil existed even in those times. I'm eager to read the next book in the sequel. If you are dedicated, the book should only take around 2 days to read.My notes:Lord Brahma, the Creator, one of the greatest scientists ever. He was credited with many inventions upon which the Vedic way of life had been built. His disciples lived by the code he’d established: relentless pursuit of knowledge and selfless service to society. They had, over the years, evolved into the tribe of Brahma, or Brahmins.This statement gives idea about the birth of Brahmin Caste. It should be noted that there is nothing special about initial Brahmins. It seems like they have come together because of their interest in knowledge. It is not at all by their birth.Periodically, when a way of life became inefficient, corrupt or fanatical, a new leader emerged, who guided his people to an improved social order. Vishnu was an ancient title accorded to the greatest of leaders, idolised as the Propagators of Good. The Vishnus were worshipped like Gods.So Ekam or One God sends a person on this planet who brings radical changes to corrupted lifestyles of people.It was well known that the moon shone with the reflected light of the sun. Poetically, the sun was the face and the moon its reflection;it tells about the scientific knowledge of ancient Indians.That names guided destiny was an ancient belief.Parents chose the names of their children with care. A name, in a sense, became an aspiration, swadharma, individual dharma, for the child.So check for the meaning of your name. May be god has created you for that purpose.😄 Atleast act according your name. For example, my name meaning is: The one who doesn't return without a victory. So I should follow the quotation: "Be like a postage stamp, stick to one thing until you get there." Isn't it?In keeping with tradition, the princes had been accorded gurukul names: Ram was called Sudas, Bharat became Vasu, Lakshman was Paurav, and Shatrughan, Nalatardak.This is just for information.‘Truth. Duty. Honour,’ said Ram,‘Live free or die,’ said Bharat,This highlights Lord Ram's attitude towards Laws. While Bharat is for liberal policies.‘Not revealing the truth is lying, isn’t it, Guruji?’ ‘No, it isn’t. Sometimes, truth causes pain and suffering. At such times, silence is preferred. In fact, there may be times when a white lie, or even an outright lie, could actually lead to a good outcome. Lying may save someone’s life. Lying may bring one into a position of authority, which in turn may result in an opportunity to do good. Would you still advocate not lying? It may well be said that a true leader loves his people more than he loves his own soul. There would be no doubt in the mind of such a leader. He would lie for the good of his people.’Wisdom lies in moderation, in balance. If you lie to save an innocent person from some bandits, is that wrong?Your habit of speaking the truth is good. But what is your reason for it? Is it because you believe it’s the lawful thing to do? Or, is it because this incident has made you fear lying?’This is the conversation between Ram and his Guru about truth. Enlightening isn't it?‘Nobody in Ayodhya gives two hoots about the law, Dada! We are a civilization in an advanced state of decay. We’re the most hypocritical people on earth. We criticize corruption in others, but are blind to our own dishonesty. We hate others who do wrong and commit crimes, blithely ignoring our own misdeeds, big and small. We vehemently blame Raavan for all our ills, refusing to acknowledge that we created the mess we find ourselves in.’‘This attitude is basic human nature. We’d rather look outward and blame others for the ills that befall us than point the finger at ourselves. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. We need a king who can create systems with which one can harness even selfish human nature for the betterment of society.’After the battle of Karchappa, the kingdom of Ayodhya becomes very weak financially. This is mainly because of Raavan's aggressive trade policies causing losses among people. Everybody blames Raavan for his trade policies, forgetting that Ayodhya lost a war because of hasty decisions. This victory of Raavan has made him unquestionable.So the discussion above is "We blame someone else for our mistakes and misfortunes."‘There’s a thin line that separates courage from stupidity.’‘And that line is only visible in retrospect, my friend. If I’m successful, people will call me brave. If I fail, I will be called foolish. Let me do what I think is right. I’ll leave the verdict to the future.’ you compromise the prospects of the strong, and lean too much towards the interests of the weak, then your society itself goes into decline.I think this is the biggest problem with communist ideology.You should leave the strong in their own way until they don't interfere with your efforts to uplift the weak.‘A real leader doesn’t choose to lead only the deserving.He will, instead, inspire his people into becoming the best that they are capable of.A real leader will not defend a monster, but convert that demon into a God; tap into the God that dwells within even him.He takes upon himself the burden of dharma sankat, but he ensures that his people become better human beings.’Ram says the above after his victory with Raavan at Mithila. He knows that if Asurastra is used then he will be banished for 14 years. But to save people, he should use Asurastra. So he takes the burden of living a hermit life for the sake of people.So a real leader will do Selfless service for his people. He takes upon as much fault on himself to make their lives better.Sometimes wrath is required to deliver justice. But the strange thing about anger is that it is like fire; the more you feed it, the more it grows. It takes a lot of wisdom to know when to let anger go.This is the problem with using violent methods for solution. it is like a fire, you will need more of it, even after your main purpose is completed. This is also highlighted by Tales of Man Singh - Kenneth Anderson. He says that Man Singh has started to save weaker sections from stronger section. But as he used violent methods, he keeps on killing many many people. At the end he is classified as murderer but the society doesn't change at large. There are many reasons for this:May be people have thought that Man Singh was a rumor.A covert gang cannot create its own law for a vast country like India.Stronger sections always find a loop hole in everything. I think Man Singh was trying to destroy the effect leaving the cause on its own.Interestingly, Lord Yama was revered as both the God of Death as well as the God of Dharma. The ancients believed that dharma and death were interlinked.In a sense, a tally sheet was drawn at the end of one’s mortal life; if there was an imbalance, the soul would have to return to physical form in another mortal body; if the accounts were in balance and karma was in alignment with dharma, then the soul would attain ultimate salvation: release from the cycle of rebirth, and reunification with the universal soul, the Parmatma, the Ekam, the Brahman.So the concept is death is simply a kind of financial year where you publish your accounts. If the market is happy your share value increases, otherwise you might even see the demise.So, I think ancient people's thinking of Lord Yama as Lord for Dharma was also right. Because as soon as he takes the life, he will also make a judgement on where to send the soul to: Heaven? Hell? or club it with Parmatma?You are law-abiding people; you follow the masculine way. But your laws are not working anymore. They haven’t been for centuries, because the world has changed. That is what karma is trying to teach you, again and again. If karma is giving you a negative signal repeatedly, then it is not testing you, it is trying to teach you. You need to tap into the disciple in you and find a new Shukracharya. You need a new masculine way. You need new laws.’This conversation happens between Lord Ram and Asuras. The key takeaway here is:If you are not able to achieve success, then it is only a fault in yourself. Take note of it, change your ways, try another way. Hit the target. Here Shukracharya is Guru for Asuras, but in reality we should be our own Shukracharya, find new self-discipline and work with new ways to catch our result.Simply giving up in the middle of the process, or trying with the same approach which has failed will not work. Instead you should learn from past mistakes and make amendments to your constitution.‘And if the Ekam is beyond all this [materialistic world], how can He pick a side?’ asked Ram.‘If He is beyond form then how can He have a preference for any one form? He can, therefore, never belong to any one specific group. He belongs to all, and at the same time, to none. And this is not just applicable to human beings but to every created entity in the universe: animals, plants, water, earth, energy, stars, space, everything. Regardless of what they do or think or believe, all created entities belong to, and are drawn from, the Ekam.’‘This fundamental misunderstanding between our world of forms, and the Ekam’s formless world, makes them believe in the lie that my God is the true God and your God is a false God. Just like a wise human will have no preference for his kidneys over his liver, the One God will not pick one group over another. It’s stupid to even think otherwise.’This shows how ancient Indian's considered every life as precious and form of god. We should also understand that Hindus also believed that there is one god, who is governing this whole universe(similar to Christianity). In fact, the concept of Ekam is beyond: even non-living things are also considered as some creation of god and so needs to be respected.For example: Indian's have immense respect for rivers. They also offer prayers to rivers.In essence treat every one and everything with respect. You are not beyond anything. Be humble. Remember? Humility was one of the virtues suggested by Benjamin Franklin to young people of the world.‘Shukracharya was right in wanting to create a perfect masculine society. Such a society is efficient, just, and honorable. The mistake he made was that he based it on faith. He should have built it purely on laws, keeping the spiritual separate from the material. When times change, as they inevitably do, one finds it impossible to give up on one’s faith; in fact, one clings to it with renewed vigor. Difficult times make men cling to their faith even more strongly. But if you base a masculine way of life on laws, then, possibly, when needed, the laws can be changed. The masculine way of life should be built on laws, not faith.’We should never mix religion with laws and society. Faith should be your own personal thing. Founding fathers of India knew this very well. So they never introduced any religious concept in our constitution. This probably is the reason why India has survived as a union till today. If religious sermons are made into laws, then the biggest problem is that the society will not progress. Because religious laws were formed many many years ago based on the then society. Religion is not something where you can speak of amendments. So without amendments how can you progress? Even further this can create intolerance in people and can create chaos.For example:Sukracharya's people were rigid in their belief of Ekam and so never tolerated people who believed other gods.Many islamic countries are today facing these kind of problems.Of late in India, mention of religion(s) in CAA, NRC has created chaos.In the middle ages of the Devas, the caste system, which was originally based on karma and not birth, became rigid, sectarian and politicized. This allowed the Asuras to easily defeat them. When the later Devas reformed and made the caste system flexible again, they regained their strength and defeated the Asuras.’I think even today, the caste system should be completely abolished. The main reason is every person takes pride in his job. So he being a parent will only force his/her child to do that job even if his child has interests in some other field. For example, when I was young, my interests were to start an airline and build a vast business empire. Every time I confessed this to my father, he always discouraged me. He would only say, that we are not for business and our way of life was to learn and work under someone.(of course he has seen his brother fail with the concept of business) Again I was also fascinated about those giant Diesel locomotives. When I proposed I wanted to work with railways, my parents both discouraged me. They instead wanted me to work for Oil companies. This is one of the reason for why I hated those Oil companies.Anyways, the concept is observe and encourage your child in the direction s/he can make an impact. It doesn't matter if it is a field that doesn't pay well or is not respected. Every field has a legend, and your child can be next legend. Also, be happy if your child chooses a very rare field. There is very less competition😉.Life is complicated, and a balanced person can see both sides.‘Sometimes, to create a perfect world, a leader has to do what is necessary at the time; even if it may not appear to be the “right” thing to do in the short term. In the long run, a leader who has the capacity to uplift the masses must not deny himself that opportunity. He has a duty to not make himself unavailable. A true leader will even take a sin upon his soul for the good of his people.’I remember an anecdote: PV Narsimha Rao, former prime minister of India while introducing reforms was said to have encouraged Manmohan Singh, then finance minister as follows:If anything goes wrong, then it will be my fault as a leader. If everything goes as per plan and society benefits, then the credit is yours.Exceptional leader, isn't he?And today, India is an assertive power in international affairs, partly because of his liberalization.Another example is Jawaharlal Nehru who took the burden of leading a new India. Some of his reforms/decisions have gone wrong. He courageously took all the critics, but till end he thrived to uplift every poor Indian. A leader is not just one who leads. He must also be a role model. He must practise what he preaches......Obvious, because if he doesn't practice what he preaches who will listen to him? For example if a person(a very good leader) who is a hard core non-vegetarian(eats what ever animal he finds) talks about animal rights, will you listen?‘Well, Lord Rudra had said: “A leader is not just one who gives his people what they want. He must also be the one who teaches his people to be better than they imagined themselves to be”.’In reply, Lady Mohini said that people have their limitations. A leader should not expect more from them than what they are capable of. If you stretch them beyond their capacity, they will break.There is always a maximum for everything!! But that should not stop a good leader from trying to achieve as much as s/he can for his people.Sita had thought long and hard about the meaning of equality. She felt that just promoting equality before the law would not solve society’s problems. She believed that true equality existed only at the level of the soul. But in this material world, everyone was, in fact, not equal. No two created entities were exactly the same. Among humans, some were better at knowledge, others at warfare, some at trading and others offered their manual skills and hard work. She believed that a society would be perfect only if people were free to do what they actually wanted to, based on their karma, rather than following the diktats of the caste they were born into.I think, this is the simple reason for how reservations in India have overcome legal hurdles. But still today India is an unequal society mainly because of caste feelings.Most of the democracies somehow at the end will and should fall in line with this concept, atleast in the application law.We need to be harsh to destroy this birth-based caste system,’ said Sita. ‘It has weakened our dharma and our country. It must be destroyed for the good of India. If we don’t destroy the caste system as it exists today, we will open ourselves to attacks from foreigners. They will use our divisions to conquer us.’Lady Sita's warnings were true. There were so many invasions which exploited caste based system prevalent in those times. Examples are Mughals, Britishers etc.Lady Sita proposed that all the children of a kingdom must be compulsorily adopted by the state at the time of birth. The birth-parents would have to surrender their children to the kingdom. The kingdom would raise these children, educate and hone the natural skills that they were born with. At the age of fifteen, they would appear for an examination that would test them on their physical, psychological and mental skills. Based on the result, appropriate castes would be allocated to the children.Subsequent training would further polish their natural talent, after which the children would be put up for adoption by citizens from the same caste as the ones assigned to the adolescents through the examination process. The children would never know their birth-parents, only their caste-parents.Of course this is an impossible thing. But we should find some or the other way to abolish caste system. We should understand that the above system if modified can become possible. Don't ask me the modifications to be made, I don't know. My opinion is everybody's thought is of some value to make this country a great one. Instead of skirting the opinion we should try to make a note of it and move ahead. ‘But polygamy is unfair only according to you[Lord Ram]; others may disagree. Remember, justice in terms of “right” or “wrong” is a man-made concept. It is entirely up to us to define justice in new terms of what is fair or unfair. It will be for the greater good.’I think this type of philosophy is called deist theory. Please correct me, if I'm wrong. I read about this type of philosophy in Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography.‘You know, Guru Vashishtha had said to me, when I was a child, that compassion is sometimes an overrated virtue.He told me the story of the butterfly emerging from the hard pupa.It squeezes through this tiny opening and struggles to make its way out. This is a difficult, painful and prolonged process. Misguided compassion may make us want to enlarge the hole in the pupa, imagining that it would ease the butterfly’s task. But that struggle is necessary; as the butterfly squeezes its body out of the tiny hole, it secretes fluids within its swollen body. This fluid goes to its wings, strengthening them;Without the struggle, its wings would never gain strength. It would never fly.’This is a very simple example on why man shouldn't interfere with nature's processes. At the end he will only destroy himself. In other words, if a person is struggling in his journey to become great then we should leave him for himself and should not interfere. I think this is the main reason why great people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Jack Ma... who talk about helping people don't simply give money to everyone. I don't know if I'm making sense to you, but I'm making sense to myself. As they have climbed that ladder they knew that with hard work, patience, perseverance, every person will make it there without great people's help.So it is better to leave that person to create his own journey which can make him more happy than the person who receives someone's gratitude. It is the law of nature isn't it?But you should help a person who is in need.  For example, help a hungry person, help a sick person, vaccinate a child etc... mainly so that they can live and make themselves happy." />

In the long run, a leader who has the capacity to uplift the masses must not deny himself that opportunity. He has a duty to not make himself unavailable. A true leader will even take a sin upon his soul for the good of his people.’I remember an anecdote: PV Narsimha Rao, former prime minister of India while introducing reforms was said to have encouraged Manmohan Singh, then finance minister as follows:If anything goes wrong, then it will be my fault as a leader. If everything goes as per plan and society benefits, then the credit is yours.Exceptional leader, isn't he?And today, India is an assertive power in international affairs, partly because of his liberalization.Another example is Jawaharlal Nehru who took the burden of leading a new India. Some of his reforms/decisions have gone wrong. He courageously took all the critics, but till end he thrived to uplift every poor Indian. A leader is not just one who leads. He must also be a role model. He must practise what he preaches......Obvious, because if he doesn't practice what he preaches who will listen to him? For example if a person(a very good leader) who is a hard core non-vegetarian(eats what ever animal he finds) talks about animal rights, will you listen?‘Well, Lord Rudra had said: “A leader is not just one who gives his people what they want. He must also be the one who teaches his people to be better than they imagined themselves to be”.’In reply, Lady Mohini said that people have their limitations. A leader should not expect more from them than what they are capable of. If you stretch them beyond their capacity, they will break.There is always a maximum for everything!! But that should not stop a good leader from trying to achieve as much as s/he can for his people.Sita had thought long and hard about the meaning of equality. She felt that just promoting equality before the law would not solve society’s problems. She believed that true equality existed only at the level of the soul. But in this material world, everyone was, in fact, not equal. No two created entities were exactly the same. Among humans, some were better at knowledge, others at warfare, some at trading and others offered their manual skills and hard work. She believed that a society would be perfect only if people were free to do what they actually wanted to, based on their karma, rather than following the diktats of the caste they were born into.I think, this is the simple reason for how reservations in India have overcome legal hurdles. But still today India is an unequal society mainly because of caste feelings.Most of the democracies somehow at the end will and should fall in line with this concept, atleast in the application law.We need to be harsh to destroy this birth-based caste system,’ said Sita. ‘It has weakened our dharma and our country. It must be destroyed for the good of India. If we don’t destroy the caste system as it exists today, we will open ourselves to attacks from foreigners. They will use our divisions to conquer us.’Lady Sita's warnings were true. There were so many invasions which exploited caste based system prevalent in those times. Examples are Mughals, Britishers etc.Lady Sita proposed that all the children of a kingdom must be compulsorily adopted by the state at the time of birth. The birth-parents would have to surrender their children to the kingdom. The kingdom would raise these children, educate and hone the natural skills that they were born with. At the age of fifteen, they would appear for an examination that would test them on their physical, psychological and mental skills. Based on the result, appropriate castes would be allocated to the children.Subsequent training would further polish their natural talent, after which the children would be put up for adoption by citizens from the same caste as the ones assigned to the adolescents through the examination process. The children would never know their birth-parents, only their caste-parents.Of course this is an impossible thing. But we should find some or the other way to abolish caste system. We should understand that the above system if modified can become possible. Don't ask me the modifications to be made, I don't know. My opinion is everybody's thought is of some value to make this country a great one. Instead of skirting the opinion we should try to make a note of it and move ahead. ‘But polygamy is unfair only according to you[Lord Ram]; others may disagree. Remember, justice in terms of “right” or “wrong” is a man-made concept. It is entirely up to us to define justice in new terms of what is fair or unfair. It will be for the greater good.’I think this type of philosophy is called deist theory. Please correct me, if I'm wrong. I read about this type of philosophy in Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography.‘You know, Guru Vashishtha had said to me, when I was a child, that compassion is sometimes an overrated virtue.He told me the story of the butterfly emerging from the hard pupa.It squeezes through this tiny opening and struggles to make its way out. This is a difficult, painful and prolonged process. Misguided compassion may make us want to enlarge the hole in the pupa, imagining that it would ease the butterfly’s task. But that struggle is necessary; as the butterfly squeezes its body out of the tiny hole, it secretes fluids within its swollen body. This fluid goes to its wings, strengthening them;Without the struggle, its wings would never gain strength. It would never fly.’This is a very simple example on why man shouldn't interfere with nature's processes. At the end he will only destroy himself. In other words, if a person is struggling in his journey to become great then we should leave him for himself and should not interfere. I think this is the main reason why great people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Jack Ma... who talk about helping people don't simply give money to everyone. I don't know if I'm making sense to you, but I'm making sense to myself. As they have climbed that ladder they knew that with hard work, patience, perseverance, every person will make it there without great people's help.So it is better to leave that person to create his own journey which can make him more happy than the person who receives someone's gratitude. It is the law of nature isn't it?But you should help a person who is in need.  For example, help a hungry person, help a sick person, vaccinate a child etc... mainly so that they can live and make themselves happy." /><meta property="og:url" content="https://ap-9512.github.io/my-notes-and-review-book-ram.html" /><meta property="og:type" content="article" />

You will understand that there are many broken links in colloquial Ramayan. I didn't feel boring at all. You will understand that, evil existed even in those times. I'm eager to read the next book in the sequel. If you are dedicated, the book should only take around 2 days to read.</p>\n<h2>My notes:</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success dropcap\">Lord Brahma, the Creator, one of the greatest scientists ever. He was credited with many inventions upon which the Vedic way of life had been built. His disciples lived by the code he’d established: relentless pursuit of knowledge and selfless service to society. They had, over the years, evolved into the tribe of Brahma, or Brahmins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This statement gives idea about the birth of Brahmin Caste. It should be noted that there is nothing special about initial Brahmins. It seems like they have come together because of their interest in knowledge. <em>It is not at all by their birth.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Periodically, when a way of life became inefficient, corrupt or fanatical, a new leader emerged, who guided his people to an improved social order. <em>Vishnu was an ancient title accorded to the greatest of leaders, idolised as the Propagators of Good. The Vishnus were worshipped like Gods.</em><br><br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So <em>Ekam or One God</em> sends a person on this planet who brings radical changes to corrupted lifestyles of people.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">It was well known that the moon shone with the reflected light of the sun. Poetically, the sun was the face and the moon its reflection;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>it tells about the scientific knowledge of ancient Indians.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">That names guided destiny was an ancient belief.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Parents chose the names of their children with care. A name, in a sense, became an aspiration, swadharma, individual dharma, for the child.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So check for the meaning of your name. May be god has created you for that purpose.😄 Atleast act according your name. For example, my name meaning is: The one who doesn't return without a victory. So I should follow the quotation: \"Be like a postage stamp, stick to one thing until you get there.\" Isn't it?</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">In keeping with tradition, the princes had been accorded gurukul names: Ram was called Sudas, Bharat became Vasu, Lakshman was Paurav, and Shatrughan, Nalatardak.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is just for information.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">‘Truth. Duty. Honour,’ said Ram,<br>‘Live free or die,’ said Bharat,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This highlights Lord Ram's attitude towards Laws. While Bharat is for liberal policies.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">‘Not revealing the truth is lying, isn’t it, Guruji?’ ‘No, it isn’t. Sometimes, truth causes pain and suffering. At such times, silence is preferred. In fact, there may be times when a white lie, or even an outright lie, could actually lead to a good outcome. Lying may save someone’s life. Lying may bring one into a position of authority, which in turn may result in an opportunity to do good. Would you still advocate not lying? It may well be said that a true leader loves his people more than he loves his own soul. There would be no doubt in the mind of such a leader. He would lie for the good of his people.’</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Wisdom lies in moderation, in balance. If you lie to save an innocent person from some bandits, is that wrong?</em></span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Your habit of speaking the truth is good. But what is your reason for it? Is it because you believe it’s the lawful thing to do? Or, is it because this incident has made you fear lying?’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the conversation between Ram and his Guru about truth. Enlightening isn't it?</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">‘Nobody in Ayodhya gives two hoots about the law, Dada! We are a civilization in an advanced state of decay. We’re the most hypocritical people on earth. We criticize corruption in others, but are blind to our own dishonesty. We hate others who do wrong and commit crimes, blithely ignoring our own misdeeds, big and small. We vehemently blame Raavan for all our ills, refusing to acknowledge that we created the mess we find ourselves in.’</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">‘This attitude is basic human nature. We’d rather look outward and blame others for the ills that befall us than point the finger at ourselves. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. We need a king who can create systems with which one can harness even selfish human nature for the betterment of society.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After the battle of Karchappa, the kingdom of Ayodhya becomes very weak financially. This is mainly because of Raavan's aggressive trade policies causing losses among people. Everybody blames Raavan for his trade policies, forgetting that Ayodhya lost a war because of hasty decisions. This victory of Raavan has made him unquestionable.</p>\n<p>So the discussion above is <strong>\"We blame someone else for our mistakes and misfortunes.\"</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">‘<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>There’s a thin line that separates courage from stupidity.</em></span>’</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">‘And that line is only visible in retrospect, my friend. If I’m successful, people will call me brave. If I fail, I will be called foolish. Let me do what I think is right. I’ll leave the verdict to the future.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\"> you compromise the prospects of the strong, and lean too much towards the interests of the weak, then your society itself goes into decline.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is the biggest problem with communist ideology.</p>\n<p>You should leave the strong in their own way until they don't interfere with your efforts to uplift the weak.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">‘A real leader doesn’t choose to lead only the deserving.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">He will, instead, inspire his people into becoming the best that they are capable of.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">A real leader will not defend a monster, but convert that demon into a God; tap into the God that dwells within even him.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">He takes upon himself the burden of dharma sankat, but he ensures that his people become better human beings.’<br><br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ram says the above after his victory with Raavan at Mithila. He knows that if Asurastra is used then he will be banished for 14 years. But to save people, he should use Asurastra. So he takes the burden of living a hermit life for the sake of people.</p>\n<p>So a real leader will do <em><strong>Selfless</strong></em> service for his people. He takes upon as much fault on himself to make their lives better.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Sometimes wrath is required to deliver justice. But the strange thing about anger is that it is like fire; the more you feed it, the more it grows. It takes a lot of wisdom to know when to let anger go.<br><br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is <em>the problem with using violent methods for solution</em>. it is like a fire, you will need more of it, even after your main purpose is completed. </p>\n<p>This is also highlighted by <em>Tales of Man Singh - Kenneth Anderson.</em> He says that Man Singh has started to save weaker sections from stronger section. But as he used violent methods, he keeps on killing many many people. At the end he is classified as murderer but the society doesn't change at large. There are many reasons for this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>May be people have thought that Man Singh was a rumor.</li>\n<li>A covert gang cannot create its own law for a vast country like India.</li>\n<li>Stronger sections always find a loop hole in everything. I think Man Singh was trying to destroy the effect leaving the cause on its own.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Interestingly, Lord Yama was revered as both the God of Death as well as the God of Dharma. The ancients believed that dharma and death were interlinked.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">In a sense, a tally sheet was drawn at the end of one’s mortal life; if there was an imbalance, the soul would have to return to physical form in another mortal body; if the accounts were in balance and karma was in alignment with dharma, then the soul would attain ultimate salvation: release from the cycle of rebirth, and reunification with the universal soul, the Parmatma, the Ekam, the Brahman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the concept is death is simply a kind of financial year where you publish your accounts. If the market is happy your share value increases, otherwise you might even see the demise.</p>\n<p>So, I think ancient people's thinking of Lord Yama as Lord for Dharma was also right. Because as soon as he takes the life, he will also make a judgement on where to send the soul to: Heaven? Hell? or club it with Parmatma?</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">You are law-abiding people; you follow the masculine way. But your laws are not working anymore. They haven’t been for centuries, because the world has changed. That is what karma is trying to teach you, again and again. If karma is giving you a negative signal repeatedly, then it is not testing you, it is trying to teach you. You need to tap into the disciple in you and find a new Shukracharya. You need a new masculine way. You need new laws.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This conversation happens between Lord Ram and Asuras. The key takeaway here is:</p>\n<p>If you are not able to achieve success, then it is only a fault in yourself. Take note of it, change your ways, try another way. Hit the target. Here Shukracharya is Guru for Asuras, but in reality we should be our own Shukracharya, find new self-discipline and work with new ways to catch our result.</p>\n<p>Simply giving up in the middle of the process, or trying with the same approach which has failed will not work. Instead you should learn from past mistakes and make amendments to your constitution.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">‘And if the Ekam is beyond all this [materialistic world], how can He pick a side?’ asked Ram.<br>‘If <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>He is beyond form</em></span> then how can He have a preference for any one form? He can, therefore, never belong to any one specific group. He belongs to all, and at the same time, to none. And this is not just applicable to human beings but to every created entity in the universe: animals, plants, water, earth, energy, stars, space, everything. Regardless of what they do or think or believe, all created entities belong to, and are drawn from, the Ekam.’</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">‘This fundamental misunderstanding between our world of forms, and the Ekam’s formless world, makes them believe in the lie that my God is the true God and your God is a false God. Just like a wise human will have no preference for his kidneys over his liver, the One God will not pick one group over another. It’s stupid to even think otherwise.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This shows how ancient Indian's considered every life as precious and form of god. We should also understand that Hindus also believed that there is one god, who is governing this whole universe(similar to Christianity). </p>\n<p>In fact, the concept of Ekam is beyond: even non-living things are also considered as some creation of god and so needs to be respected.<br>For example: Indian's have immense respect for rivers. They also offer prayers to rivers.</p>\n<p>In essence treat every one and everything with respect. You are not beyond anything. Be humble. Remember? Humility was one of the virtues suggested by Benjamin Franklin to young people of the world.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">‘Shukracharya was right in wanting to create a perfect masculine society. Such a society is efficient, just, and honorable. <br>The mistake he made was that he based it on faith. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><u>He should have built it purely on laws, keeping the spiritual separate from the material. When times change, as they inevitably do, one finds it impossible to give up on one’s faith; in fact, one clings to it with renewed vigor.</u></em> </span>Difficult times make men cling to their faith even more strongly. <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">But if you base a masculine way of life on laws, then, possibly, when needed, the laws can be changed. The masculine way of life should be built on laws, not faith.</span></em>’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We should never mix religion with laws and society. Faith should be your own personal thing. Founding fathers of India knew this very well. So they never introduced any religious concept in our constitution. This probably is the reason why India has survived as a union till today. </p>\n<p>If religious sermons are made into laws, then the biggest problem is that the society will not progress. Because religious laws were formed many many years ago based on the then society. Religion is not something where you can speak of amendments. So without amendments how can you progress? Even further this can create intolerance in people and can create chaos.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sukracharya's people were rigid in their belief of Ekam and so never tolerated people who believed other gods.</li>\n<li>Many islamic countries are today facing these kind of problems.</li>\n<li>Of late in India, mention of religion(s) in CAA, NRC has created chaos.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">In the middle ages of the Devas, the caste system, which was originally based on karma and not birth, became rigid, sectarian and politicized. This allowed the Asuras to easily defeat them. When the later Devas reformed and made the caste system flexible again, they regained their strength and defeated the Asuras.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think even today, the caste system should be completely abolished. The main reason is every person takes pride in his job. So he being a parent will only force his/her child to do that job even if his child has interests in some other field. For example, when I was young, my interests were to start an airline and build a vast business empire. Every time I confessed this to my father, he always discouraged me. He would only say, that we are not for business and our way of life was to learn and work under someone.(of course he has seen his brother fail with the concept of business) Again I was also fascinated about those giant Diesel locomotives. When I proposed I wanted to work with railways, my parents both discouraged me. They instead wanted me to work for Oil companies. This is one of the reason for why I hated those Oil companies.</p>\n<p>Anyways, the concept is observe and encourage your child in the direction s/he can make an impact. It doesn't matter if it is a field that doesn't pay well or is not respected. Every field has a legend, and your child can be next legend. Also, be happy if your child chooses a very rare field. There is very less competition😉.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Life is complicated, and a balanced person can see both sides.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">‘Sometimes, to create a perfect world, a leader has to do what is necessary at the time; even if it may not appear to be the “right” thing to do in the short term.

<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>My Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐(5/5)</strong></p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>My Review: </strong>This book, will show you Ramayan with a complete new and <em>interesting </em>picture. You will understand that there are many broken links in colloquial Ramayan. I didn't feel boring at all. You will understand that, evil existed even in those times. I'm eager to read the next book in the sequel. If you are dedicated, the book should only take around 2 days to read.</p>
<h2>My notes:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success dropcap">Lord Brahma, the Creator, one of the greatest scientists ever. He was credited with many inventions upon which the Vedic way of life had been built. His disciples lived by the code he’d established: relentless pursuit of knowledge and selfless service to society. They had, over the years, evolved into the tribe of Brahma, or Brahmins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement gives idea about the birth of Brahmin Caste. It should be noted that there is nothing special about initial Brahmins. It seems like they have come together because of their interest in knowledge. <em>It is not at all by their birth.</em></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">Periodically, when a way of life became inefficient, corrupt or fanatical, a new leader emerged, who guided his people to an improved social order. <em>Vishnu was an ancient title accorded to the greatest of leaders, idolised as the Propagators of Good. The Vishnus were worshipped like Gods.</em><br><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So <em>Ekam or One God</em> sends a person on this planet who brings radical changes to corrupted lifestyles of people.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">It was well known that the moon shone with the reflected light of the sun. Poetically, the sun was the face and the moon its reflection;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it tells about the scientific knowledge of ancient Indians.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">That names guided destiny was an ancient belief.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">Parents chose the names of their children with care. A name, in a sense, became an aspiration, swadharma, individual dharma, for the child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So check for the meaning of your name. May be god has created you for that purpose.😄 Atleast act according your name. For example, my name meaning is: The one who doesn't return without a victory. So I should follow the quotation: "Be like a postage stamp, stick to one thing until you get there." Isn't it?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">In keeping with tradition, the princes had been accorded gurukul names: Ram was called Sudas, Bharat became Vasu, Lakshman was Paurav, and Shatrughan, Nalatardak.</p>

<p>This is just for information.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Truth. Duty. Honour,’ said Ram,<br>‘Live free or die,’ said Bharat,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This highlights Lord Ram's attitude towards Laws. While Bharat is for liberal policies.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Not revealing the truth is lying, isn’t it, Guruji?’ ‘No, it isn’t. Sometimes, truth causes pain and suffering. At such times, silence is preferred. In fact, there may be times when a white lie, or even an outright lie, could actually lead to a good outcome. Lying may save someone’s life. Lying may bring one into a position of authority, which in turn may result in an opportunity to do good. Would you still advocate not lying? It may well be said that a true leader loves his people more than he loves his own soul. There would be no doubt in the mind of such a leader. He would lie for the good of his people.’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Wisdom lies in moderation, in balance. If you lie to save an innocent person from some bandits, is that wrong?</em></span></p>
<p class="msg msg--success">Your habit of speaking the truth is good. But what is your reason for it? Is it because you believe it’s the lawful thing to do? Or, is it because this incident has made you fear lying?’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the conversation between Ram and his Guru about truth. Enlightening isn't it?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Nobody in Ayodhya gives two hoots about the law, Dada! We are a civilization in an advanced state of decay. We’re the most hypocritical people on earth. We criticize corruption in others, but are blind to our own dishonesty. We hate others who do wrong and commit crimes, blithely ignoring our own misdeeds, big and small. We vehemently blame Raavan for all our ills, refusing to acknowledge that we created the mess we find ourselves in.’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘This attitude is basic human nature. We’d rather look outward and blame others for the ills that befall us than point the finger at ourselves. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. We need a king who can create systems with which one can harness even selfish human nature for the betterment of society.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the battle of Karchappa, the kingdom of Ayodhya becomes very weak financially. This is mainly because of Raavan's aggressive trade policies causing losses among people. Everybody blames Raavan for his trade policies, forgetting that Ayodhya lost a war because of hasty decisions. This victory of Raavan has made him unquestionable.</p>
<p>So the discussion above is <strong>"We blame someone else for our mistakes and misfortunes."</strong></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>There’s a thin line that separates courage from stupidity.</em></span>’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘And that line is only visible in retrospect, my friend. If I’m successful, people will call me brave. If I fail, I will be called foolish. Let me do what I think is right. I’ll leave the verdict to the future.’</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success"> you compromise the prospects of the strong, and lean too much towards the interests of the weak, then your society itself goes into decline.</p>

<p>I think this is the biggest problem with communist ideology.</p>
<p>You should leave the strong in their own way until they don't interfere with your efforts to uplift the weak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘A real leader doesn’t choose to lead only the deserving.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">He will, instead, inspire his people into becoming the best that they are capable of.</p>

<p class="msg msg--success">He takes upon himself the burden of dharma sankat, but he ensures that his people become better human beings.’<br><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ram says the above after his victory with Raavan at Mithila. He knows that if Asurastra is used then he will be banished for 14 years. But to save people, he should use Asurastra. So he takes the burden of living a hermit life for the sake of people.</p>
<p>So a real leader will do <em><strong>Selfless</strong></em> service for his people. He takes upon as much fault on himself to make their lives better.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">Sometimes wrath is required to deliver justice. But the strange thing about anger is that it is like fire; the more you feed it, the more it grows. It takes a lot of wisdom to know when to let anger go.<br><br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <em>the problem with using violent methods for solution</em>. it is like a fire, you will need more of it, even after your main purpose is completed. </p>
<p>This is also highlighted by <em>Tales of Man Singh - Kenneth Anderson.</em> He says that Man Singh has started to save weaker sections from stronger section. But as he used violent methods, he keeps on killing many many people. At the end he is classified as murderer but the society doesn't change at large. There are many reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>May be people have thought that Man Singh was a rumor.</li>
<li>A covert gang cannot create its own law for a vast country like India.</li>
<li>Stronger sections always find a loop hole in everything. I think Man Singh was trying to destroy the effect leaving the cause on its own.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">Interestingly, Lord Yama was revered as both the God of Death as well as the God of Dharma. The ancients believed that dharma and death were interlinked.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">In a sense, a tally sheet was drawn at the end of one’s mortal life; if there was an imbalance, the soul would have to return to physical form in another mortal body; if the accounts were in balance and karma was in alignment with dharma, then the soul would attain ultimate salvation: release from the cycle of rebirth, and reunification with the universal soul, the Parmatma, the Ekam, the Brahman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the concept is death is simply a kind of financial year where you publish your accounts. If the market is happy your share value increases, otherwise you might even see the demise.</p>
<p>So, I think ancient people's thinking of Lord Yama as Lord for Dharma was also right. Because as soon as he takes the life, he will also make a judgement on where to send the soul to: Heaven? Hell? or club it with Parmatma?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">You are law-abiding people; you follow the masculine way. But your laws are not working anymore. They haven’t been for centuries, because the world has changed. That is what karma is trying to teach you, again and again. If karma is giving you a negative signal repeatedly, then it is not testing you, it is trying to teach you. You need to tap into the disciple in you and find a new Shukracharya. You need a new masculine way. You need new laws.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conversation happens between Lord Ram and Asuras. The key takeaway here is:</p>
<p>If you are not able to achieve success, then it is only a fault in yourself. Take note of it, change your ways, try another way. Hit the target. Here Shukracharya is Guru for Asuras, but in reality we should be our own Shukracharya, find new self-discipline and work with new ways to catch our result.</p>
<p>Simply giving up in the middle of the process, or trying with the same approach which has failed will not work. Instead you should learn from past mistakes and make amendments to your constitution.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘And if the Ekam is beyond all this [materialistic world], how can He pick a side?’ asked Ram.<br>‘If <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>He is beyond form</em></span> then how can He have a preference for any one form? He can, therefore, never belong to any one specific group. He belongs to all, and at the same time, to none. And this is not just applicable to human beings but to every created entity in the universe: animals, plants, water, earth, energy, stars, space, everything. Regardless of what they do or think or believe, all created entities belong to, and are drawn from, the Ekam.’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘This fundamental misunderstanding between our world of forms, and the Ekam’s formless world, makes them believe in the lie that my God is the true God and your God is a false God. Just like a wise human will have no preference for his kidneys over his liver, the One God will not pick one group over another. It’s stupid to even think otherwise.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows how ancient Indian's considered every life as precious and form of god. We should also understand that Hindus also believed that there is one god, who is governing this whole universe(similar to Christianity). </p>
<p>In fact, the concept of Ekam is beyond: even non-living things are also considered as some creation of god and so needs to be respected.<br>For example: Indian's have immense respect for rivers. They also offer prayers to rivers.</p>
<p>In essence treat every one and everything with respect. You are not beyond anything. Be humble. Remember? Humility was one of the virtues suggested by Benjamin Franklin to young people of the world.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Shukracharya was right in wanting to create a perfect masculine society. Such a society is efficient, just, and honorable. <br>The mistake he made was that he based it on faith. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><u>He should have built it purely on laws, keeping the spiritual separate from the material. When times change, as they inevitably do, one finds it impossible to give up on one’s faith; in fact, one clings to it with renewed vigor.</u></em> </span>Difficult times make men cling to their faith even more strongly. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But if you base a masculine way of life on laws, then, possibly, when needed, the laws can be changed. The masculine way of life should be built on laws, not faith.</span></em>’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should never mix religion with laws and society. Faith should be your own personal thing. Founding fathers of India knew this very well. So they never introduced any religious concept in our constitution. This probably is the reason why India has survived as a union till today. </p>
<p>If religious sermons are made into laws, then the biggest problem is that the society will not progress. Because religious laws were formed many many years ago based on the then society. Religion is not something where you can speak of amendments. So without amendments how can you progress? Even further this can create intolerance in people and can create chaos.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sukracharya's people were rigid in their belief of Ekam and so never tolerated people who believed other gods.</li>
<li>Many islamic countries are today facing these kind of problems.</li>
<li>Of late in India, mention of religion(s) in CAA, NRC has created chaos.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">In the middle ages of the Devas, the caste system, which was originally based on karma and not birth, became rigid, sectarian and politicized. This allowed the Asuras to easily defeat them. When the later Devas reformed and made the caste system flexible again, they regained their strength and defeated the Asuras.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think even today, the caste system should be completely abolished. The main reason is every person takes pride in his job. So he being a parent will only force his/her child to do that job even if his child has interests in some other field. For example, when I was young, my interests were to start an airline and build a vast business empire. Every time I confessed this to my father, he always discouraged me. He would only say, that we are not for business and our way of life was to learn and work under someone.(of course he has seen his brother fail with the concept of business) Again I was also fascinated about those giant Diesel locomotives. When I proposed I wanted to work with railways, my parents both discouraged me. They instead wanted me to work for Oil companies. This is one of the reason for why I hated those Oil companies.</p>
<p>Anyways, the concept is observe and encourage your child in the direction s/he can make an impact. It doesn't matter if it is a field that doesn't pay well or is not respected. Every field has a legend, and your child can be next legend. Also, be happy if your child chooses a very rare field. There is very less competition😉.</p>

<p class="msg msg--success">Life is complicated, and a balanced person can see both sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Sometimes, to create a perfect world, a leader has to do what is necessary at the time; even if it may not appear to be the “right” thing to do in the short term. In the long run, a leader who has the capacity to uplift the masses must not deny himself that opportunity. He has a duty to not make himself unavailable. A true leader will even take a sin upon his soul for the good of his people.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember an anecdote: PV Narsimha Rao, former prime minister of India while introducing reforms was said to have encouraged Manmohan Singh, then finance minister as follows:</p>
<p>If anything goes wrong, then it will be my fault as a leader. If everything goes as per plan and society benefits, then the credit is yours.</p>
<p>Exceptional leader, isn't he?</p>
<p>And today, India is an assertive power in international affairs, partly because of his liberalization.</p>
<p>Another example is Jawaharlal Nehru who took the burden of leading a new India. Some of his reforms/decisions have gone wrong. He courageously took all the critics, but till end he thrived to uplift every poor Indian. </p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">A leader is not just one who leads. He must also be a role model. He must practise what he preaches......</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obvious, because if he doesn't practice what he preaches who will listen to him? For example if a person(a very good leader) who is a hard core non-vegetarian(eats what ever animal he finds) talks about animal rights, will you listen?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘Well, Lord Rudra had said: “A leader is not just one who gives his people what they want. He must also be the one who teaches his people to be better than they imagined themselves to be”.’</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">In reply, Lady Mohini said that people have their limitations. A leader should not expect more from them than what they are capable of. If you stretch them beyond their capacity, they will break.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is always a maximum for everything!! But that should not stop a good leader from trying to achieve as much as s/he can for his people.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">Sita had thought long and hard about the meaning of equality. She felt that just promoting equality before the law would not solve society’s problems. She believed that true equality existed only at the level of the soul. But in this material world, everyone was, in fact, not equal. No two created entities were exactly the same. Among humans, some were better at knowledge, others at warfare, some at trading and others offered their manual skills and hard work. She believed that a society would be perfect only if people were free to do what they actually wanted to, based on their karma, rather than following the diktats of the caste they were born into.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think, this is the simple reason for how reservations in India have overcome legal hurdles. But still today India is an unequal society mainly because of caste feelings.</p>
<p>Most of the democracies somehow at the end will and should fall in line with this concept, atleast in the application law.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">We need to be harsh to destroy this birth-based caste system,’ said Sita. ‘It has weakened our dharma and our country. It must be destroyed for the good of India. If we don’t destroy the caste system as it exists today, we will open ourselves to attacks from foreigners. They will use our divisions to conquer us.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Sita's warnings were true. There were so many invasions which exploited caste based system prevalent in those times. Examples are Mughals, Britishers etc.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Lady Sita proposed that all the children of a kingdom must be compulsorily adopted by the state at the time of birth. The birth-parents would have to surrender their children to the kingdom. The kingdom would raise these children, educate and hone the natural skills that they were born with. At the age of fifteen, they would appear for an examination that would test them on their physical, psychological and mental skills. Based on the result, appropriate castes would be allocated to the children.<br><br></p>
<p>Subsequent training would further polish their natural talent, after which the children would be put up for adoption by citizens from the same caste as the ones assigned to the adolescents through the examination process. The children would never know their birth-parents, only their caste-parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course this is an impossible thing. But we should find some or the other way to abolish caste system. We should understand that the above system if modified can become possible. Don't ask me the modifications to be made, I don't know. My opinion is everybody's thought is of some value to make this country a great one. Instead of skirting the opinion we should try to make a note of it and move ahead. </p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘But polygamy is unfair only according to you[Lord Ram]; others may disagree. Remember, justice in terms of “right” or “wrong” is a man-made concept. It is entirely up to us to define justice in new terms of what is fair or unfair. It will be for the greater good.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this type of philosophy is called deist theory. Please correct me, if I'm wrong. I read about this type of philosophy in Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p class="msg msg--success">‘You know, Guru Vashishtha had said to me, when I was a child, that compassion is sometimes an overrated virtue.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">He told me the story of the butterfly emerging from the hard pupa.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">It squeezes through this tiny opening and struggles to make its way out. This is a difficult, painful and prolonged process. Misguided compassion may make us want to enlarge the hole in the pupa, imagining that it would ease the butterfly’s task. But that struggle is necessary; as the butterfly squeezes its body out of the tiny hole, it secretes fluids within its swollen body. This fluid goes to its wings, strengthening them;</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">Without the struggle, its wings would never gain strength. It would never fly.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very simple example on why man shouldn't interfere with nature's processes. At the end he will only destroy himself. </p>
<p>In other words, if a person is struggling in his journey to become great then we should leave him for himself and should not interfere. </p>
<p>I think this is the main reason why great people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Jack Ma... who talk about helping people don't simply give money to everyone. I don't know if I'm making sense to you, but I'm making sense to myself. As they have climbed that ladder they knew that with hard work, patience, perseverance, every person will make it there without great people's help.</p>
<p>So it is better to leave that person to create his own journey which can make him more happy than the person who receives someone's gratitude. It is the law of nature isn't it?</p>
<p>But you should help a person who is in need.  For example, help a hungry person, help a sick person, vaccinate a child etc... mainly so that they can live and make <em>themselves</em> happy.</p>
